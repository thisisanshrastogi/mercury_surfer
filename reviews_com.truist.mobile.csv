I really don't understand what is up with this app so slow lags crashes all the time I have to fight with it for hours to be able to pay my rent through zelle the online banking app is so messed up that I'm literally thinking about switching banks,2025-05-23,1
won't update nor open,2025-05-23,1
"so bad but all minor stuff that really adds up to major annoyance. no biometrics, I can't transfer from outside account to directly pay my credit line, then when I do xfer to checking and make payment it takes days to show in the credit line. not a convenient app and honestly my banking experience has been just as bad. would definitely recommend to look elsewhere",2025-05-22,1
have to keep updating every other day,2025-05-21,1
cannot upgrade Ok,2025-05-21,1
these people are really bad if you have any disputes they will not side with you they will side with the business,2025-05-21,1

Refuses to recognize endorsement/signature of mobile deposit.,2025-05-21,1
calendar function for selecting the delivery date for bill payment is dysfunctional. no month or year are indicated in the selection calendar. payments mistakenly scheduled for 2026 instead of 2025.,2025-05-20,1
Charge overdraft fees for no reason!,2025-05-20,1
"Got misinformed about a hold by two different representatives, the next day I'm given virtually a shrug by a supervisor about it and told I need to wait. I asked to have only a portion of the funds released as my account would be overdrawn, but got led in circles and had to argue with another representative who also told me I was SOL. They don't care about their customers, I've been banking here for 4 years and not once have I've had such an issue depositing a check before.",2025-05-20,1
The slowest app and the worst Bank hands down. They like to take money for nothing while they make interest off your money. I moved my money out. Looking forward to them going out of business. It's around the corner.,2025-05-19,1
"5/16/25- This app is still trash. The fact I run a business and can't deposit checks is ridiculous. REALLY considering switching banks to a bank that can get their app together and let people do business that they pay to do at this bank. If I could give zero stars, I would. Sad, I can't do business with truist because they want me to purchase a check deposit machine so they can charge me more money to do business with them.",2025-05-16,1
"this is beyond the worst banking app I have you can't pay bills without using a pen and paper cause it will not allow you to see the last payment without going to details and you can't pay from details. the UI appears to be written by a 30 year old pissed off programmer who just wanted to piss others off to feel like him. BBT had a better app, BA and Wells Fargo are better apps. funny how this is the 4 th update and it just gets worst.",2025-05-15,1
"Need to fix the mobile deposit functionality. Used almost a year, depositing the same check every month and one day doesn't work. Customer support was nice but absolutely not helpful.",2025-05-14,1
"If I could give them zero stars I would I pay on time in full my cc every month and this moronic bank and they always take $55.00 twice on the same day from my account on top of my full cc payment, and when I call to the F. Truist they got no idea or pretend that they don't know what's going on and send me to different departments so I can desist. Also, I got scammed for $19.95 online, and I got a letter telling me that they would NOT reimburse that money? I had it. I'm canceling my account.",2025-05-13,1
made 2 online check deposits..last night before cut off time. never went thru. quit saying you are sorry and get this pos working last night before 8 never went thru,2025-05-13,1
"do not recommend this bank, they play with numbers if you watch your account closely and steal your money. Switching banks. negative stars if I could.",2025-05-13,1
"the app is horrible, to say the least. my information does not show correctly, and due to that, my card declines when I try to use it to purchase items. Trust do better.",2025-05-12,1
"When depositing your checks, they say that the money will not be available until the next business day. However, you can PAY a fee if you'd like your funds available right away. How is this right and fair?? I have an account with you? Why not put my money right away into my account if it was possible? What a scam!!",2025-05-09,1
Will not work. saying it's not updated!!!,2025-05-09,1
"the typical take your money in one day, but when you mess up a payment, it takes 9 to 20 business days to get a refund. They also want to charge you 35$ to send it back. I always pay a little after my due date,the 25th on every month, typically pay on the 1st. I've asked them to change my date but told me it doesn't matter for up to 14 days. I always select other amounts. Wish they could help me out sooner. I officially do not like Triust Bank. I need to refinance, anyone have a good place?",2025-05-08,1
trash app takes forever to load when logging in,2025-05-06,1
ridiculous,2025-05-06,1
"the app keeps telling me there's an update..I click update, and it doesn't do anything. each time, I have to uninstall and reinstall the app, but this time, that's not working..just keeps saying it needs an update!! Annnd it's doing it AGAIN...this is ridiculous",2025-05-05,1

what happened to my external accounts?,2025-05-02,1
"It keeps saying that it needs an update, then I hit update. Then nothing happens. It sends me right back to the signing page. I cannot sign into my app at all!!!",2025-04-30,1
"annoying - keeps asking me to go paperless. When the account was opened, the bank employee set the preference as paper statements. I set up statements in the app to receive paper statements three times. I uninstalled and reinstalled the app. The app prompted me to go paperless. I continued with paper statements. I set the preference in the app a fourth time to give me paper statements. The app still prompts me to go paperless every time I open it. It's not a bad app if it didn't annoy me.",2025-04-30,1
"Where to start, before truist became truist they were once bb&t and a few other banks, I was a customer with bb&t and never had an issue with them, up until truist took over. Their app almost never works, can't dispute transactions over the app gotta call, have had random charges hundreds of times just to be put on hold to try and get my money back. Their mobile deposit literally never works, currently sitting on a check I can't cash because it didn't want to work at the ATM, or mobile deposit.",2025-04-26,1
"2/23/2022 Had to delete my previous low opinion of this app to write this one. Another 5 days of being unable to deposit checks within this app, get all the way through the process and says ""technical issues"" or logs me out - so time wasting. 4/26/2025 3 years later same problems, UGH!",2025-04-26,1
barely functional,2025-04-26,1
All week now ??? (The service you are attempting to access is currently unavailable. Please try again later.) That's all I get every time the app tries to verify my device.,2025-04-26,1
this app has too many problems.,2025-04-24,1
Terrible experience. Three fraud charges the last month. Tons of time wasted. My accountant has another client with the same problem. They have major security issues!,2025-04-24,1
hate it,2025-04-23,1
"I can no longer use the app. claims there is an update and then directs me to the install page. I un-installed the app and reinstalled it. still nothing. it was great, now an error code ""CM."" shucks",2025-04-23,1
wish you had early payroll pay,2025-04-23,1

app logs out while trying to mobile deposit,2025-04-21,1
My app won't update,2025-04-21,1
Impossible to make electronic deposits. Not capable of scanning signature. Totally useless for this function.,2025-04-21,1
the bank needs to learn not to have all of their drive through lights green when they only have 1 teller to service the drive through. it's misleading an complete bs as it is a constant inconvenience,2025-04-21,1
I have zelle and still can't receive funds sent to me It's very annoying!!!!😡😡😡😡😡,2025-04-20,1
"Selecting a day on the calendar in the new bill pay is ridiculous. It has 2 sets of arrows, no month, and the arrows are backwards. Only way to tell if the day you chose is in the correct month is to choose a day somewhat blindly and check it on the next screen.",2025-04-19,1
"Absolutely frustrating. I used the SunTrust app for years with no problems. Suddenly truist has the wrong password and locks me out despite my password being stored in my manager. I go to reset it, but to verify you need a text, and somehow truist has the completely wrong number on the account despite me getting SunTrust texts for years and verifying my number long ago. Truist continues to have THE worst account/login system of any app I have ever used in my life. If I could rate it -5 stars.",2025-04-19,1
"This app is constantly going down. You would think with a business as big as this, they would have it under control. There are too many people that rely in online banking for this to happen so much. Please get it fixed!",2025-04-18,1
it won't let you update,2025-04-17,1
I keep having to reinstall the app and it still doesn't work.,2025-04-16,1
"you have to fix the changes you made to the calendar selector on the bill pay section of this app. the controls are confusing, not labeled, and you cannot tell what month/ year you selected! if you're not paying attention you could very easily schedule a payment for next year instead of next month.",2025-04-15,1
just is not working,2025-04-14,1
there is always a 30 second delay timer to pull up your account when you login. it's impossible to locate the ATM page because they don't call it atm they call it find us and it's hidden in settings. they do these to reduce withdrawals. their bill pay does not work. every check arrives late. I constantly get charged late fees and then they compound late fees upon late fees. they delay your check in the mail just like they delay your login. you get charged higher fees than every other bank.,2025-04-14,1
"Genuinely one of the least user-friendly banking apps out there. I use it out of necessity, but these people are crazy with their security. I got locked out of my account on a Sunday all because I wanted to deposit a check and had to keep trying because apparently the ""forgot password"" only works during normal bank hours. If banking apps exist so you can access your account outside of hours, what is the sense in limiting you to bank hours? Guess I'll have to waste gas on Monday. Thanks Truist.",2025-04-13,1
When I try to go to app it says I need to update but when I press update it takes me to uninstall or open does not give update option.,2025-04-13,1
Thea pp don't work after updating. I can't access account. it ask to update. Then goes to open back to update. It want login,2025-04-11,1

can never get into this site,2025-04-11,1
"can't login, keeps telling me can't convert HTML to Jsonoject",2025-04-09,1
Make sure you keep your own ledger. Nothing ever adds up properly on this app until days/weeks after no new transactions. They've also stopped notifying me properly when any transaction happens that exceeds my limit set. Sometimes I don't get notified at all. Other times days or weeks AFTER they've already taken from my account. What's the point in an app if it doesn't work properly? Calling the national CS number is a waste of time. They don't understand English enough to help in any way.,2025-04-08,1
I wish there was a negative star to use in rating.,2025-04-08,1
"Whatever new update they have done in April 2025 is horrible!! The app constantly logs me out in the middle of a check deposit! OVER AND OVER AGAIN!! I HATE this stupid bank! If I had an option I would definitely change banks but I've been paying for an insurance policy that is only avaliable thru the account, paying for about 15 yrs now, it would be stupid to drop the account/ policy now 😠 😡 😤",2025-04-07,1
this bank is not right or trust worthy took my money and my social security number And closed my account without notifying me I had to go to the branch to find out this not so professional but I'm good on any banks at this point cause I'm about to go paper checks therefore I know my personal information is safe,2025-04-04,1

"I can't even log into your app anymore, using biometrics just loops and asks for the biometrics again, using password gives some strange error, and not an incorrect password error. if this isn't fixed soon I won't be able to use you as my bank, as I'm going overseas.",2025-04-02,1
"you have the worst banking app ever, I can't send money with zelle when I want to. If I lock and unlock my cards, I can't use them until after 20mins. that's insane. the app rejects yours passcode you've been logging in with.",2025-04-02,1
App would not update on Samsung S25.. please fix..,2025-04-02,1
"The camera angle's terrible. It doesn't tell you what to do what you're doing wrong.It doesn't tell you to stop and redo it over.If the pictures aren't clear or if he keeps on gailing your air, it's frustrating.It took me literally 5 to ten minutes to try to take this deposit",2025-04-01,1

"Random glitches, password doesn't save, weird layout, why can I see my family's accounts. Why did they roll out this app if doesn't even work. Apparently this company is worth 50B$. and y'all still can't make an app that works properly 10% of the time. switch industries RIGHT NOW",2025-03-25,1

"Fix your app. The auto capture is absolutely horrible. It's now telling me I am missing endorsement but I clearly have it signed. The hell is wrong with this app? Bb&T was far better then this garbage. Update 2025: Their damn app still crashes when you do an auto capture. I figured they'll fix it but nope, it still an issue!",2025-03-14,1
This should be a zero I don't understand why Truist keeps changing my function for getting text messages for Zelle. I have fixed this over and over and it continues to go to my email and we don't have the choice to change it back. This is ridiculous. I don't need all these messages going to my email. I did not request to change my function back so I would like to have that option. If not I'm going to any bank and I'm going to put this all on social media.,2025-03-14,1
"There is no recuring payments you can make while using Zelle. I can not view a history of Zelle payments. That would be nice. Come to think of it, I can not see or search for recurring bank paymets made via my bank routing number.

"Constantly needing to call tech support because I'm unable to access my accounts. Error messages that dont make sense. I'm ready to change banks which isn't fun either, but better then this every time I try signing in! Since this bank merged ... the online banking is constant problems! Before merge Suntrust was great! From day one this has been going on! That's about 3 yrs ago. This is the worst app ever ! Here I go again have to Uninstall & install to get in!

These people might have fixed their check deposit system however paying system is a complete disaster. Every single time I try to pay a bill I get this message in a Redbox at the top. The service you're attempting to access is currently unavailable please try again later.

Complicated,2025-02-10,1
"UPDATE 2/8/25: bugs persist. Terrible app. Find another bank! UPDATE: Buggy UX still exists. Security is a major concern. Neither the app or website offer 2-factor authentication as far as I've been able to find.

Suddenly it says I need to update the app when I sign in and I cant access any of my information. Go into my app manager and app says it's up to date. Ridiculous. My wifes phone works fine. She's on iPhone and I'm on Android. The reference code it gives me is GM. I'm switching banks if this isn't resolved ASAP. I've un-installed and reinstalled many times already for it to work once before kicking me back out and giving me the same notification. You're killing me Truist.,2025-01-23,1

I have to use the regular payment screen and toggle it to recurring, then toggle off biweekly because you're weirdly making that the default; and then it tells me I have a recurring payment already scheduled, but it's more than 14 days away, so I can't adjust it",2025-01-16,1

Suddenly it says I need to update the app when I sign in and I cant access any of my information. Go into my app manager and app says it's up to date. Ridiculous. My wifes phone works fine. She's on iPhone and I'm on Android. The reference code it gives me is GM. I'm switching banks if this isn't resolved ASAP. I've un-installed and reinstalled many times already for it to work once before kicking me back out and giving me the same notification. You're killing me Truist.,2025-01-23,3

Let me be the first to share my personal opinion whoever requested the update button be pushed BEFORE the actual updates were completed in the App did not know what they were doing, as the App is definitely incomplete, and certainly not ready for clients to update anything at this time.

This is an awful app for managing a mortgage, why don't you have a dedicated autopay page like every other major bank or credit card? I have to use the regular payment screen and toggle it to recurring, then toggle off biweekly because you're weirdly making that the default; and then it tells me I have a recurring payment already scheduled, but it's more than 14 days away, so I can't adjust it",2025-01-16,3

"It was fine, but now it won't let me sign on. First, it stopped letting me use my fingerprint, seemingly insisting on my password but when I entered that it, a popup appeared with a lot of gobbledy- good jargon and an OK button that basically does nothing. Addendum: I have seen your kind response and have reached out as instructed. Thank you!",2024-08-30,3
"Good app other than the fact that the autocapture for remotely depositing checks refuses to take a photo unless it is absolutely perfect, and then refuses to recognize my signature on the check.",2024-08-30,3
"Since the latest update to either the app in general or the bill pay portion alone (of both the app and website) pending payment dates no longer show, only delivery dates. Pending dates are helpful to know when the money needs to be available in order to pay the bill. Why was that view discontinued?",2024-08-25,3
Clunky,2024-08-22,3
The app doesn't always recognize my signature on the back of the check when I attempt to do a mobile deposit. Sometimes it will work when I try later and other times I need to go to the bank to deposit the check. It is very frustrating and time consuming.,2024-08-14,3
too many issues with having an account with this company. I recommend going somewhere else.,2024-08-13,3
App doesn't load well for no apparent reason.,2024-08-09,3
"Crashes constantly. Impossible to get pages to load in a timely manner, or at all. I miss the BBT app, this sucks. Good mobile banking is the most important factor to an account for me. May have to consider switching if Truist doesn't get up to speed. Update 3 years later-- same issues",2024-08-09,3
"I haven't had a problem with the app until the most recent update. Considering I don't know how to report a problem within the app to let the appropriate person know the problems I'm experiencing, I feel like I need to leave a negative review. The problem is I can't view my transactions. I've tried three different methods to access my transaction history. All have failed. I tried signing out and signing back in, closing the app, switching from mobile data to wifi, and it won't load at all.",2024-08-09,3
truist believes that if you use mobile banking that you shouldn't receive a paper copy of your account. it has been years for them to agree to send me paper copies. I'm grateful that they have agreed finally. I can't do everything on my phone! I don't have access to a laptop. Be sensitive to the needs of others!,2024-08-07,3
Not cool being charged consistently to cash my own check every time I use your bank. Truist is supposed to be my bank but it sure does not feel like it.,2024-08-01,3
Good guy to talk to straightened everything out fine,2024-07-31,3
App sometimes won't let me type in username or password. It's random. I uninstall then download again same issue. All other apps are allowing me to tap the screen. I can go through web version but wondering what good the app is if I'm having to do that so regularly?,2024-07-30,3
"cannot add reoccurring payments with my personal checking account. Had to use an account I didn't want to use, because it wouldn't verify my first one for some reason. overall very frustrating!",2024-07-14,3
Sucks,2024-07-13,3
This app logs me out and then when I try to login it says that my info isn't correct even when I know it is. To fix the problem I had to go all the way to the bank and have someone help me. This app has been very inconvenient for me.,2024-06-30,3
"Biometric login is broken with this last update. Whenever I enable biometrics, the app crashes upon opening. And when I disable biometrics, the login screen wants me to login with biometrics instead of just logging in with username and password. 6/28 update: biometrics appears fixed with the May update but now there is a java error when attempting to login. I dont see where theres been an update since May, so perhaps it is backend.",2024-06-28,3
"Update: The app no longer registers ANY input at all, I've uninstalled and re installed it, and I'VE changed literally nothing. The account search bar has never worked, and still doesn't, and since becoming truist(from SunTrust) the amount of info on the transaction has decreased aswell. A worse app.",2024-06-26,3

"Great security, horrible Mobile deposit, yo7 endorse the check take the pictures but once you take the back picture and it says missing signature but it's endorsed with a black sharpie pen never had this problem before until this year and when I called support they told me it has something to do with cell service but you know I guess sitting next to wifi router isn't enough no you need FULL 5g service so I find the sweet spot and what do you know still says MISSING SIGNATURE I JUST WANNA GET 💵",2024-06-08,3
Reasonable functional if rather pedestrian in it's layout and design. Check deposit feature is useful but automatic photo capture is unreliable and unstable,2024-05-27,3

"Everything works fine except zelle. App crashes every time I use it and that's a pretty big deal seeing as most people use it frequently, if not daily.",2024-05-14,3
Customer service is awful everyone is Indian and does not understand what your saying to a professional degree. Problem solving is very difficult and overall your better off dealing with a nearby branch or not all with this company.,2024-05-11,3
"Unreliable anymore. 90% of the time I can't login, transfers between accounts aren't working, and forget trying to upload a check. No matter what you do it won't be able to recognize the check. Ive been using this app for years and never had a problem until this year.

Everytime i try to zelle the whole app crashes with a message that the developer must fix the bug in the app. Tried re install still not working,2024-04-20,3
Very unresponsive in construction phase of loan. Got 13 closing papers with different amounts due-changing the amount we needed to pay. Took a year to close the damn loan. Able to pay over the phone. Current loan officer a little more responsive. Never there when you need them. Not a one-stop shop. Call to get insurance and property tax included in the mortgage and was advised to call somewhere else. Not helpful at all.,2024-04-19,3

Absolutely will not auto take when I use other banking apps that take the picture faster than I could manually and it works fine. Then sometimes it doesn't recognize that there IS in fact a signature on the endorsement line. Tried to add external account, screen just goes black and nothing happens.

If banking apps exist so you can access your account outside of hours, what is the sense in limiting you to bank hours? Guess I'll have to waste gas on Monday. Thanks Truist.",2025-04-13,4

Make sure you keep your own ledger. Nothing ever adds up properly on this app until days/weeks after no new transactions. They've also stopped notifying me properly when any transaction happens that exceeds my limit set. Sometimes I don't get notified at all. Other times days or weeks AFTER they've already taken from my account. What's the point in an app if it doesn't work properly? Calling the national CS number is a waste of time.

"*UPDATE* Seems the issue was from an outage last night. App is working again, thank you. The only other thing that would be a great improvement is your notifications for transactions/deposits. The emails start off too non info at a glance and you can't determine what it is without opening the notification fully in the email app. The text works perfect at a glance. Email things like deposits etc you have to open up all the way 👎🏻",2024-09-23,4

Make sure you keep your own ledger. Nothing ever adds up properly on this app until days/weeks after no new transactions. They've also stopped notifying me properly when any transaction happens that exceeds my limit set. Sometimes I don't get notified at all. Other times days or weeks AFTER they've already taken from my account. What's the point in an app if it doesn't work properly? Calling the national CS number is a waste of time.

Stop the pop-up asking me for my location. It's irritating and my location is none of your business.,2024-10-04,5
will not capture any longer,2024-10-03,5
It needs a lot of work. The app won't stop trying to make me turn on location and trying to send money to anyone is a nightmare to deal with since it wants to jump to the next screen as I'm typing. The long load time with the logo before I can sign in is annoying and the amount of screen clutter while signed in is really bad. It has long away to go before I even think about five stars.,2024-09-27,5
they revised the app so you cannot see the amount you paid previously. terrible,2024-09-22,5
"Way too many maintenance updates that won't allow you to view any details for your account. It makes it very inconvenient to use, and it's a trash bank. Fix your app. I suppose one good thing about it is that they have a good customer support system and a financial plan, other than that I would suggest switching to a larger more well known bank, Truist was a merge between SunTrust and BB&T. Merging was a mistake, I liked having BB&T much better.",2024-09-22,5

"It was fine, but now it won't let me sign on. First, it stopped letting me use my fingerprint, seemingly insisting on my password but when I entered that it, a popup appeared with a lot of gobbledy- good jargon and an OK button that basically does nothing. Addendum: I have seen your kind response and have reached out as instructed. Thank you!",2024-08-30,5
"Good app other than the fact that the autocapture for remotely depositing checks refuses to take a photo unless it is absolutely perfect, and then refuses to recognize my signature on the check.",2024-08-30,5
"Since the latest update to either the app in general or the bill pay portion alone (of both the app and website) pending payment dates no longer show, only delivery dates.

Clunky,2024-08-22,5
The app doesn't always recognize my signature on the back of the check when I attempt to do a mobile deposit. Sometimes it will work when I try later and other times I need to go to the bank to deposit the check. It is very frustrating and time consuming.,2024-08-14,5

May have to consider switching if Truist doesn't get up to speed. Update 3 years later-- same issues",2024-08-09,5
"I haven't had a problem with the app until the most recent update. Considering I don't know how to report a problem within the app to let the appropriate person know the problems I'm experiencing, I feel like I need to leave a negative review. The problem is I can't view my transactions. I've tried three different methods to access my transaction history. All have failed. I tried signing out and signing back in, closing the app, switching from mobile data to wifi, and it won't load at all.",2024-08-09,5
truist believes that if you use mobile banking that you shouldn't receive a paper copy of your account. it has been years for them to agree to send me paper copies. I'm grateful that they have agreed finally. I can't do everything on my phone! I don't have access to a laptop. Be sensitive to the needs of others!,2024-08-07,5
Not cool being charged consistently to cash my own check every time I use your bank. Truist is supposed to be my bank but it sure does not feel like it.,2024-08-01,5

App sometimes won't let me type in username or password. It's random. I uninstall then download again same issue. All other apps are allowing me to tap the screen. I can go through web version but wondering what good the app is if I'm having to do that so regularly?,2024-07-30,5

This app logs me out and then when I try to login it says that my info isn't correct even when I know it is. To fix the problem I had to go all the way to the bank and have someone help me. This app has been very inconvenient for me.,2024-06-30,5
"Biometric login is broken with this last update. Whenever I enable biometrics, the app crashes upon opening. And when I disable biometrics, the login screen wants me to login with biometrics instead of just logging in with username and password. 6/28 update: biometrics appears fixed with the May update but now there is a java error when attempting to login. I dont see where theres been an update since May, so perhaps it is backend.",2024-06-28,5
"Update: The app no longer registers ANY input at all, I've uninstalled and re installed it, and I'VE changed literally nothing.

Reasonable functional if rather pedestrian in it's layout and design. Check deposit feature is useful but automatic photo capture is unreliable and unstable,2024-05-27,5

Customer service is awful everyone is Indian and does not understand what your saying to a professional degree. Problem solving is very difficult and overall your better off dealing with a nearby branch or not all with this company.,2024-05-11,5
"Unreliable anymore. 90% of the time I can't login, transfers between accounts aren't working, and forget trying to upload a check. No matter what you do it won't be able to recognize the check.

Everytime i try to zelle the whole app crashes with a message that the developer must fix the bug in the app. Tried re install still not working,2024-04-20,5
Very unresponsive in construction phase of loan. Got 13 closing papers with different amounts due-changing the amount we needed to pay. Took a year to close the damn loan. Able to pay over the phone. Current loan officer a little more responsive. Never there when you need them. Not a one-stop shop.

"Pretty functional app. Balances on the same account between different views can vary slightly, which is unacceptable. Also, the MEMO field on transactions serves no purpose. It's not stored in the ledger anywhere. Both issues were logged as bugs with Tech Support over a year ago. Frozen transactions from credit line accounts during non-business hours is total BS. This the electronic age - no teller required!",2025-01-23,5

color scheme could be improved. the ease of use is low compared to other large bank apps. I like the customer service at this bank enough to stay with 1 account but I moved all my other accounts to a bank that continually improves their app (they haven't changed since they switched from SunTrust to TRUIST. . . .and that's been way to long in my opinion (SunTrust app was better),2024-12-11,5

"*UPDATE* Seems the issue was from an outage last night. App is working again, thank you. The only other thing that would be a great improvement is your notifications for transactions/deposits. The emails start off too non info at a glance and you can't determine what it is without opening the notification fully in the email app. The text works perfect at a glance.
