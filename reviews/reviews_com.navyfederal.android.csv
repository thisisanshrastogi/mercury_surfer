guess you need a High Price Apple Phone will not work on Android!?!?!?!?!?!?!?,2025-05-24,1
"Entirely useless staff. Some bug prevents me from logging in through the browser. It just tells me my password is wrong and I need to change it. It does this all the time and it's very very annoying. I call customer support for help and they just insist to me that I am typing in my password incorrectly. It's a credit union and so that's pretty cool, but the attitude that you get from the customer service makes it not worth calling them. If you have any trouble just go to a different app",2025-05-23,1
NEW UPDATE IS HORRIBLE!!! They really need to fix this asap. I love navy federal but if I have to go to a different credit Union I guess I'll have to.,2025-05-23,1
terrible,2025-05-23,1
Why can I filter transactions on the mobile site but not the mobile app?,2025-05-22,1
most recent update will not allow me to redeem my reward on my credit card,2025-05-22,1
states not compatible with my phone and in no hell way I'm getting a new phone just for a stupid app,2025-05-22,1
Update ruined this credit union mobile app use. NOT USER FRIENDLY!,2025-05-22,1
Horrible app whose features do not work after every update. At this point it's easier to change banks than endure these constant inconveniences from this damn app!!!,2025-05-21,1
"It will not let me sign in, it just quits, or says sorry for the inconvenience and you are working on it. This App is useless.",2025-05-21,1
"New version of the app is all flair, it looks really pretty but the load times are slow and features were removed and there's no widget to see your balance, and can't even see when you get paid till like 2 days out. Not like it worked before.",2025-05-21,1
JUST DONT LIKE IT,2025-05-21,1
"I'm getting the ""Our mobile app is currently unavailable"" error for many weeks now. The version 7 update has been a messy rollout. The latest update for version 7 has fixed it for 24 hours and the error came back. Such an inconvenience for us in the digital age. Bring back version 6!",2025-05-20,1
"NOT VERY TRUTHFUL. Had a previous CC w/NFCU joint w/my son who was barely out of hs, no job, not in college nothing. Credit Limit increases came automatically bc I made the payments on time. Now my son is in military & we took me off of his card to start my own 500 credit limit. I make my payments on time before every due date & pay more than required. No increases yet. I have spoken to several representatives to get my limit increase & they refuse. I'm gonna pay card off & close card complete",2025-05-20,1
i get authentication error more than I'm able to use the app. your developers suck,2025-05-20,1

Always down.,2025-05-19,1
The App is mediocre but main complaint is the advertisement is not accurate and very hard to get a loan even with 750 credit score. second time denied. definitely pulling my business away from Navy Federal.... expected.,2025-05-19,1
Can't make mobile deposits anymore for some dumbass reason.,2025-05-19,1
The recent updates continue upgrading the UI in exchange for downgrading the UX. It looks nice yet does less. They've removed the FICO and credit score views (there is only a credit score view now) and the calendar view of transactions. I can't schedule a transaction larger than my current balance for later because the app tells me to schedule the transaction later while not allowing me to progress to the scheduler. foolishness.,2025-05-19,1
new updates never work properly,2025-05-19,1
Can never see recent transactions... what's the point if there's no live updates to account information???,2025-05-19,1
"Whenever I try to sign into my account, it consistently tells me an error has occurred & I've learned that the only way to sign back in is to reinstall the entire app. Every. Single. Time.",2025-05-18,1
The app stopped working with the new security update a couple weeks ago. Is it going to be fixed?,2025-05-18,1
"2/13/25 My review has gone from 5 stars to 1 star because their technology has been getting worse and worse to the point where I've been stranded for hours because I can't log into my account. I don't know who is over the IT department but they need to be fired IMMEDIATELY! 5/18/25 I can no longer bank with NFCU, whoever they hired is purposely sabotaging them not allowing customers access to their money and leaving people stranded. Went from hero to zero in less than a year.",2025-05-18,1
It's too much. It's gotten too bad. can't login because app is unavailable? Apps always in maintenance - just when I need it. You're gonna pay the overdraft fee at Wells Fargo. That's what I get for keeping my money in nfcu. App is going downhill. Well Fargo got goood and discover app is also awesome. An absolute disaster. Verification codes don't come thru and one can't login...,2025-05-18,1
it sucks,2025-05-17,1
"absolutely the last thing I want when it comes to my banking (besides technical issues that don't allow me to change my settings, and the constantly incorrect spending category assigned to my transactions, and app crashes, and not being able to open the app) is a change to the interface between myself and my money.",2025-05-17,1
"This app is SO BAD that I am going to close my NFCU accounts after 15 years because of this app. It is unusable, not to mention just awful looking. You guys managed to completely ruin it with the new updates. You took it from functional and intuitive to garbage. Unbelievable.",2025-05-16,1
5/16/2025 - most recent update no longer shows me transction history - I get a prompt to try again. I am an Android user and uninstalled and re-installed app and still no luck. It is very important to me to be able to see transactions so I can recognize if there is a fraudulent charge or amount and report it immediately.,2025-05-16,1
every day there is a new update that NOBODY asked for. please stop. also it would be nice if you brought back account widgets for the Google Pixel home screen.,2025-05-16,1
"Well I've opened an account at another bank due to an inoperable app. Thanks for screwing up a perfectly good thing, Navy Federal üòï",2025-05-16,1
"I'm just going to express basically with so many others already have, the new GUI is horrible, and some of my favorite features are either gone or now an extra hassle. Some of the new features are cool, but big thing for me was the calendar for upcoming transactions I could easily look to see when I was getting paid and when payments were coming out but no longer can I do this. Can we please just go back. update May 2025: yet again they have changed the GUI and I can do nothing ü•≤",2025-05-16,1
"The mobile app is worthless. Tried to deposit a valid check from the Veterans Administration,and the app would not accept it. Had my phone checked out and it wasn't my phone,even tried a brand new phone and still picture blurry. The AI system sucks.",2025-05-15,1

"rewriting review to emphasize how much the recent downturn of the app and online banking has become. 5 years ago I would have recommended Navy fed to anybody eligible. every time I have attempted to log in the last few days they have been conducting ""maintenance"" I am in the middle of PCS and buying a house and dont have access to my funds. Navy fed is making it difficult to want to stay with them.",2025-05-14,1
This app has been broken for weeks. Been a navy federal member for 13 years and never experienced it this bad. Cannot sign in or check accounts on the app.,2025-05-14,1
What developer is in this company screwing up what used to be a good app to justify their job later? This is breaching the realm of comedy at this point.,2025-05-13,1
"Sometimes, I can log in. at times, I can't. When I do login. I get logged out. App was okay. Now I can't even check my account or freeze a card unless going online or calling üëéüèæ",2025-05-13,1
"constant ""authentication failed""",2025-05-13,1
they messed this app up. it sucks now,2025-05-13,1
"Since the update in October of 2024, the app will not even allow me to sign on. It's continuously stated ""Authentication Failed"" even though I can sign in on the web browser with the same credentials. Every time I call they make me go through troubleshooting even though this isn't an issue with my phone. They're aware of this issue and the low ratings on Google Play. Apparently, this company doesn't care about their Android users. Navy Federal should be embarrassed.",2025-05-13,1
"Can't log into the app no matter what i do, the nee update wrecked it",2025-05-12,1

Can't login to access my hard earned money. fix your broken app!!,2025-05-10,1

"Like many others have stated, this app does not work since the most recent updates. In order to use it, I have to go into the app store and open it from there.

Used to a good app back then. The update to newer versions has become garbage and unreliable. Too many downtime. Options that were quite simple are now difficult or not available at all. l am very disappointed.,2025-05-10,1
"it's actually incredible how you guys have gotten even more incompetent than a couple years ago. I am done with you guys, please try to do better in the future but for now all I can tell upcoming vets is AVOID THIS BANK.

"This app used to be good. Last year, there was an update. It didn't fix anything but made it worse. It doesn't save your password. You have to receive a text message or an email just to get access to your account. Now you try to log in, and there is an error every single time. You have to keep trying every 15 mins just to access your account. I'm tired of this app. Hopefully they fix this soon! because this wastes my time and sure I'm not the only one.",2025-05-09,1

"The most recent update has been absolutely atrocious. The transfer process has been reversed, selecting the recipient account before the sending account.

Cannot stand this new update. The overall look and functionality has gone done. Can't even remember the phone I'm using so I have to waste time with 2step everytime I need to check something.

"I rarely write reviews for apps, but whoever was in charge of the recent UX decisions needs to step down because if you have tell people exactly how to find things in the app when it was pretty straightforward in the previous versions, then you're doing something wrong and it's quite evident things are really wrong with the new version with the recent new low ratings from a lot of people who used to love this app. If this move was to save money, stop and actually listen to your customer's issues",2024-12-29,3
At one point mobile banking was premier. But they removed the calendar option which was nice to be able to see on the app when deposits and transfers were going to drop. Also I can't schedule out transfers between my accounts for the future. Furthermore the billpay service has gone down hill. They used to electronically pay all my bills but now they mail out checks and I have to wait a week+ until the other party cashes the check. NFCU ya need to do better!,2024-12-28,3
"Current version 7.1.1 is terrible. Preferred method of sign in is not available. Push notifications no longer work. My device isn't remembered and manage devices has no option to add it.

The recent updates continue upgrading the UI in exchange for downgrading the UX. It looks nice yet does less. They've removed the FICO and credit score views (there is only a credit score view now) and the calendar view of transactions. I can't schedule a transaction larger than my current balance for later because the app tells me to schedule the transaction later while not allowing me to progress to the scheduler. foolishness.,2025-05-19,4

"Recent updates have addressed issues that users gave feedback on. The app is getting much better and understandable. The transfer process is still confusing though as it flip-floped 180 degrees in logic based thinking needing to-from , not from-to thinking. I can accomplish the task but it would be easy to make a mistake. It's a graphical interface, the from and to list look the same...confusing",2024-10-18,4

"I have been using this app for a number of years, without issues. As of the last month the app won't keep my login information, so now I have to go through a 2 step verification that I didn't sign up for, every time I log in. Also,I noticed that it's taking longer for my purchases to be processed. The bank is extremely convenient for my daily routine, but it's also starting to trend down. I hope the new update goes along with the accuracy, convenience, and security of previously had.",2024-10-18,4
"Would've been 5 stars but after the newest update it deleted the widget for a quick balance check. It really helped with everyday spending, as easy as it is to just open the app, it was just more convient. Bring back the widget! Please.",2024-10-16,4
"The ability to have a home screen widget on Android is gone after the new update, which is a HUGE disappointment, as this was the best and quickest way for me to keep tabs on my finances. VERY disappointed that it hasn't been reinstated. However, the new layout and features are good, but the transfer layout is still taking some getting used to. A tutorial/note would have been great to highlight the differences between the old and new apps.",2024-10-16,4

This app is okay. Logging on is always the issue. There are too many extra steps on the app that are on my phone.,2024-10-16,4
So unlike others I actually like the new app... But I'm struggling suddenly. Why can't I add a biller? It crashes and crashes and crashes. I just want to pay my bills. I'm really hoping the app regains some stability. I'll find a different way to pay the bill I wanted to add. Hopefully the instability I'm experiencing today will be resolved soon. This is people's money and clearly someone didn't test this before pushing it to production. Please do regression and stop testing with users.,2024-10-12,4

Updated app doesnt let me sign in with fingerprint even though it says fingerprint sign in. It requires my irises and doesnt recognize them most of the time. I dont have this problem with any other apps. Problem just started recently. 9/16/24 Now the app won't take my mobile deposit.

I would like to see more support on during the nights. I do most of my online stuff at night. When I wake up as I have medical problems and I have a hard time sleeping through the night. This helps me to get tired and fall back asleep to take care of my stuff online. But it always seems to be slower jammed up during the night time.

"Simply stated, the last version was better. much easier to use. The layout and navigation was much easier. This version is usable, but there wasn't a need for the changes made. They all seem superficial.",2024-11-11,4
When I opened the app I just get the blue background with the globe. I've tried uninstall/reinstall. There is another customer with a Pixel 4 in these reviews with the same issue. I have a Pixel 7. it looks like the app doesn't work with Pixel phones. I contacted customer service over a month ago and they said they would get back to me. Still waiting. Update: The latest version fixed the issue and it works.,2024-11-06,4
Issues are slowly improving! Some of the new items add nice details...,2024-11-06,4

This bank saved my bacon many times but sometimes they have really bad outages so you can't login or see anything on your account. Also wish they had more locations.,2024-11-03,4
"There have been a lot of high quality improvements to the app. I love the icon update that shows the logo of the place I swiped my card. The one thing I don't like is the money moves update. It's in the wrong order. If I'm moving money, I'm taking from and moving to. The app update is backwards and very confusing. It seems intentional to overdraft an account you're trying to add money to",2024-11-02,4
Update: thank you for fixing the issues with your app. It is working fine now.,2024-11-02,4
"Used to use this app frequently and enjoy the old interface. Absolutely, horrid after the latest update and attempted UI changes. Seems like the dev. team didn't fully test all their changes. Trying to initiate transfers in the new interface keep timing out/getting errors from the backend APIs. Guess I'm going back to having to use the Navy Fed. website for my banking needs. Edit Oct. 31, 2024 - I tried the app again and the experience has gotten better/more responsive. Updated score.",2024-11-01,4
Update: seems most of the kinks have been ironed out and the app is functioning much better than it was after the new UI was implemented. Still having to re-learn the layout but all of my previous complaints have been rectified.,2024-10-30,4
You need to bring the widget back. I checked it constantly and it was really the best part if the app for me. I don't know why you would get rid. It's so convenient.,2024-10-30,4

"App is finally working, thanks NFCU.",2024-10-28,4
"I love the ability to be able to keep up with my finances. But, now it's prompting me to put in my username, password, and use 2 step verification to log in, which is very inconvenient. Why is this happening upon the last update?",2024-10-28,4
Very convenient and easy to use.,2024-10-27,4
Best bank,2024-10-27,4
The new app is OK. It crashes at some of the most inconvenience times. When it works properly the app is ready to use.,2024-10-27,4
When it works is great.,2024-10-27,4
"This version of the NFCU App has brought on nothing but problems. Prior version worked well, since loading this version I have had to call NFCU three times to have a customer service employee reactivate access to my account, and I currently, once again, despite spending 45 minutes last night to regain access, do not have App access to my account. New App is a failure. Update - changed from 1-star to 4-stars. After working with a Customer Service Rep and uploading latest version issue is fixed.",2024-10-25,4
"It's taking a little time for me to get used to the new program, but I will get there. To many options.",2024-10-23,4
Too many times where the app won't load.,2024-10-20,4
"Seems ok, I'll know more as time goes on. Now it is October 19, 2024! For whatever reasons, this app is treating me as a new comer that hasn't already set up and downloaded this app. I'm not sure what's going on with it, yet.",2024-10-19,4

Love the app makes my banking easy but what happened to the android widget? Without it I have to log in to check my balance,2024-10-16,4
Just opened a few accounts today and installed this app. Logged in fine. Navigated through app just fine. App retains login credentials. I guess everyone that updated from an older version need to wipe cashe &/or data. It's working great for as a new install.,2024-10-15,4
"It's a good app and works well most of the time. Sometimes, it's down for maintenance. I do wish they'd stop changing the layout and transfers UI and also bring back the widgets.",2024-10-15,4
I was at the bank on Saturday. Got my new username. I can't get into my account,2024-10-14,4
The new approach is ok. The transfer section is backward. I do prefer the old app better.,2024-10-11,4
"I find this app very user-friendly and easy to navigate. 10/10/24 I have made multiple attempts to use mobile deposits function since the app was updated recently. I have checked the camera settings on the app and my camera settings, and everything is as it should be. I am unable to make a mobile deposit. The camera is either not focusing correctly or it is turning the check image sideways and enlarging it, so it is totally unusable. this needs to be fixed.",2024-10-10,4
"Just finding new insignia, rocked my confidence in changes! I believe it will be for the best! I will spend the time needed to move forward with renewed confidence and my own necessary changes!",2024-10-09,4
"Well if I had 39 cents in my account of course it isn't enough to buy anything , but if some one else wanted to pay something I didn't even order NFCU would let it go thru BUT if I tried not happening , ok then NFCU would realize evedrntly thatvj don't have enough money in my account then take it back from whoever it was and charge me 29 bucks for a restock fee and of course that was a overdraft fee on me I don't know how many months it kept coming out of my account on payday",2024-10-07,4
The newest app version is flawed. Biometric sign in no longer available and mortgage transfer are more difficult.,2024-10-06,4
"Just wanna point out, with the new update when transferring money the ""from"" and ""to"" is backwards now, in my opinion. It's always been take money FROM here TO here now it's switched and is a little irritating.",2024-10-06,4
Not happy with your new app. Logout not user friendly.,2024-10-05,4
"suddenly, the feature that allows you to search for a transaction amount (not a keyword) is gone. it was often very useful to me. please restore this feature on the next update. other than that, it's a solid app, no problems.",2024-10-05,4

"Update: The app is working properly again. The app won't open with this latest update. Keep getting a msg that says ""we're experiencing a technical problem""",2024-09-30,4

"Has technical issues now and then, but overall, it is a great app that is way more convenient than any bank.",2024-09-30,4
It keeps kicking me out of the app and I cannot access my account.,2024-09-29,4
Most recent update no longer exits app using the back button. I do not like this change. The back button should offer to sign me out.,2024-09-28,4
Great banking.,2024-09-28,4
"I like the display of upcoming transactions. However I don't like the 'edit' feature to change future transfer transactions is no longer there.

Frustrating. Logs me out every time I go to an external site with link from their app to see terms or conditions. Or checking in cd or ira rates. Logged in about 22 times this evening between midnight and 3am.,2024-09-28,4
Please bring back the ability to edit/cancel transactions/transfers. It's inconvenient to have to call to edit or cancel current or upcoming transactions/transfers,2024-09-28,4

"I don't know how my husband still has the old banking app info. I prefer that one, mine did the update and it's been nothing but issues. I can't load my account on anything I keep having to verify stuff. It's little things that are just annoying. ""Like the saying if it ain't broke don't fix it."" Definitely should have left it alone. Other than this I love Navy fed banking.",2024-09-27,4
I enjoy the mobile app but why did you get rid of pending deposits,2024-09-27,4
When it works you do not need to change it. Old saying.. If it an't broke don't fix it. Old version better. Easier to work and understand.,2024-09-27,4
I liked the app better when it had a calendar layout for planned transactions but the app works well,2024-09-25,4

You fixed something that was not broken,2024-09-17,4

"Please, Navy Federal, remove the newly updated version of your app and restore The one prior. I found it was more user-friendly, in my opinion, it showed a combined running balance of both savings/checking, there is no sign out option, so I'm signed in until whenever, who knows. . I do like a couple of the features of the new version, the description and icons of where pos sales occurred, for instance. But at a glance, it's not as straightforward as prior app.",2024-09-13,4

"After this latest update, pending deposits do not show up",2024-09-13,4

Had to drop to 4 stars. Can no longer make a pmt over current balance even thou i have pending amts waiting to post. Very annoying.

Been with navy and marine fed for years and with latest update by navy fed it's disappointing. It's not as friendly can't see upcoming deposits anymore. No more widget to view quick balance. Layout and format are changed. All together not happy with the latest update,2024-09-11,4
I could not stand before loging into this app but now you dont have to log in..just open the app and you got your account info including all accounts. Thanks nfcu for this tool love it Update: it's cool to change an app but to me the original app wasn't broken. It could use a speed boost when browsing through stuff but I don't like that under my checking. My bills are not including and pending transactions.

"Entirely useless staff. Some bug prevents me from logging in through the browser. It just tells me my password is wrong and I need to change it. It does this all the time and it's very very annoying. I call customer support for help and they just insist to me that I am typing in my password incorrectly. It's a credit union and so that's pretty cool, but the attitude that you get from the customer service makes it not worth calling them.

The recent updates continue upgrading the UI in exchange for downgrading the UX. It looks nice yet does less. They've removed the FICO and credit score views (there is only a credit score view now) and the calendar view of transactions.

The app is decent but the most recent update got rid of the account balance widget and that's a huge disappointment. I used that widget for a quick at a glance way to see how much I had in my checking but now I have to go all the way into the app to check my balance and it feels like a huge step backwards. Please bring back the widget. Update: Have lowered my rating because even after multiple updates the account balance widget is still gone. If it's brought back I'll update my rating.,2025-02-13,5

I never received the products that I ordered. Had no way of contacting the merchant . I responded to NFCU request. Well according to them, I didn't.

"One of the better bank apps I have to use. But recent updates changed a couple UI experiences that I'd like to change back or erase. One, the back button option as a sign off function is nice. Having to search for the sign off button is a hassle and doesn't promote good security. Number two is the transfer money window. To transfer money, it has always been "" from "" and ""to"", not ""to"" then ""from"" order of accounts. I can't be the only one that finds this confusing and irritating.",2025-03-14,5
"Update: I've learned a workaround for transferring funds to an external bank, but I do wish you'd at least add an ACCOUNT PREVIEW, so you don't have to completely log in just to check account balances.

Like removing calander view, a simple function that did not need to be removed, I used it alot & hope it's restored soon. Also,switching acc transfers settings, used to be 'from' then 'to', now its the opposite as 'to' then 'from' & keeps throwing me off. Unnecessary changes that didn't need to be made.",2025-01-27,5

"I used to love the app, and now it's more like Lil Tay. We all love to hate it. The new update was good, but it is a little frustrating not being able to plan out life and outings without having the pay calendar.

"The new app is a step backwards for me. It was a great app. But now, the new app doesn't allow fingerprint biometrics as it used to. It also doesn't list my phone (the phone I'm using the app with!) anymore as a trusted registered device so that I can quickly verify security with a push notification for a security confirmation. Everything WAS great, & nothing has changed on my end, the only thing that has changed is this app, & it's a step backward for me as a user.",2024-10-23,5
Not really liking the new app..,2024-10-23,5
"The new update made navigation difficult and faulty. Here are my issues with it. 1. Transferring money. Before you had to select which account the money is coming from and where it is going. That has since flipped. Even navigation to Zelle has changed so it's now in 'move money' tab. 2. Edit account views is broken. If you change any views, the save button is disabled so you have to push 'cancel' and 'exit'.",2024-10-23,5

"I like being a NFCU customer, but I am disappointed by this app. It used to work fine. Every few times I log in, I get a notice stating that the email I have on file is invalid. It's odd because it's the same email I've used online and through the app for more than five years. I called tech support on 10/14 and the email address verification we did over the phone appears to have held until 10/18 when it was back to the same 'invalid email' notice. I'm reinstalling it now.",2024-10-19,5

I used and spoke to one of your people earlier this morning and finally used my finger print and it worked finally, but ONLY 1time.

"Recent updates have addressed issues that users gave feedback on. The app is getting much better and understandable. The transfer process is still confusing though as it flip-floped 180 degrees in logic based thinking needing to-from , not from-to thinking. I can accomplish the task but it would be easy to make a mistake. It's a graphical interface, the from and to list look the same...confusing",2024-10-18,5
They made it more confusing to make principle payments on mortgages.,2024-10-18,5
"I have been using this app for a number of years, without issues. As of the last month the app won't keep my login information, so now I have to go through a 2 step verification that I didn't sign up for, every time I log in. Also,I noticed that it's taking longer for my purchases to be processed. The bank is extremely convenient for my daily routine, but it's also starting to trend down. I hope the new update goes along with the accuracy, convenience, and security of previously had.",2024-10-18,5
"Would've been 5 stars but after the newest update it deleted the widget for a quick balance check. It really helped with everyday spending, as easy as it is to just open the app, it was just more convient. Bring back the widget! Please.",2024-10-16,5
"The ability to have a home screen widget on Android is gone after the new update, which is a HUGE disappointment, as this was the best and quickest way for me to keep tabs on my finances. VERY disappointed that it hasn't been reinstated. However, the new layout and features are good, but the transfer layout is still taking some getting used to. A tutorial/note would have been great to highlight the differences between the old and new apps.",2024-10-16,5

This app is okay. Logging on is always the issue. There are too many extra steps on the app that are on my phone.,2024-10-16,5
So unlike others I actually like the new app... But I'm struggling suddenly. Why can't I add a biller? It crashes and crashes and crashes. I just want to pay my bills. I'm really hoping the app regains some stability. I'll find a different way to pay the bill I wanted to add. Hopefully the instability I'm experiencing today will be resolved soon. This is people's money and clearly someone didn't test this before pushing it to production. Please do regression and stop testing with users.,2024-10-12,5

"I finally figured out most of the new features and how to find the things I need; only took 3 weeks since the September update to make it reasonably usable. Features like ""change my pin"" are theoretically useful, but the ability to edit my recurring internal transfers is GONE. I have to cancel and then add them back in. This is baloney. It's gotten more needlessly complicated each year.",2024-10-11,5
I hate that the calendar feature is no longer apart of the app. I hope this is fixed eventually,2024-10-10,5
"The app seems to be a little more evened out, but please bring back widget support. It was very useful to be able to see account balances without having to log into the app constantly.",2024-10-10,5

Updated app doesnt let me sign in with fingerprint even though it says fingerprint sign in. It requires my irises and doesnt recognize them most of the time. I dont have this problem with any other apps. Problem just started recently. 9/16/24 Now the app won't take my mobile deposit. It automatically crashes at the same place every time I try it. 10/8/24 The app keeps getting worse. Now I'm unable to schedule a Transfer in the future if the funds are not already in the account.,2024-10-08,5
"Is it true? Did Navy Federal really remove the ability to have a widget that tells me my account balance so easily and conveniently?? Please answer and don't say ""Thank you for using new Mobile app. We continue to develop and improve new features. We appreciate your feedback."" Which btw, is completely robotic and dismissive of all the reviews. Try ""Thank you for using the new NFCU app. We are continuing to develop and improve new features. We appreciate your feedback."" That's more correct.",2024-10-07,5
The new app is unable to enable biometric logins and stopped working with the prior ones. There are so many of these little breaks that it had me wondering if I was being scammed with a fake app. I have been avoiding this app for the last few weeks out of an abundance of caution.,2024-10-07,5

The newest updated app portion for transferring money is dumb and you should fire whoever came up with it. Having to select where I want the money to go first and then select where it's coming from is backwards. Change it back to where you select the money you want to move.,2024-10-05,5
"The new design isn't polished at all. The travel plans calendar for this month is wrong; today is Saturday 5 Oct, but the calendar in the app shows it's Wednesday.

I would like to see more support on during the nights. I do most of my online stuff at night. When I wake up as I have medical problems and I have a hard time sleeping through the night. This helps me to get tired and fall back asleep to take care of my stuff online. But it always seems to be slower jammed up during the night time.

Over all the app is great. Right now it keeps crashing on me. Constantly having issues. I keep sending crash reports. But nothing has changed. The app won't let me save my biometric stuff. Just crashes and kicks me out of the app. It makes me have to send a code every time I open the app. It's getting more than frustrating at this point.,2024-12-01,5
"Most important: Dark Mode. Please, I beg of you, become the cool kid on the block and actually add a dark mode.

Updating from 1 start since I can now login with my personal account again,2024-11-21,5
I've used this mobile app ever since it first came out if I can do it anyone can do it. The longer time goes on the more complicated the world gets scammers and fraudsters are running the show I think we try to do too many fancy things with new apps and forget you don't have to romance us just to get the job done.
