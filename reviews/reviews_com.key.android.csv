"app fails to fully launch, gets stuck on the key bank loading screen.",2025-05-23,1
"Have been banking with KeyBank for over 6 years and overall, KeyBank is one of the worst banks I've ever dealt with. Their website interface is clunky, their processes are outdated (e.g. cannot make extra principal payments with monthly payments on Home Equity loans, online bill pay is clunky and not user friendly) and their ATMs are difficult to access. There are MUCH better banks out there who are better aligned to customers' needs/wants.",2025-05-22,1
the lack of available ATM machines and the few that are left in my area?? broken. You cost me money to gain access to my money because you take away ATM's and can't keep the few left running. Do better,2025-05-21,1
"Easily the worst banking app I have. Runs slow. Loads for minutes on end before it let's me into the app, if it even let's me in the app. Beyond slow!...then your response is the most elementary of responses ""Delete and redownload...make sure you have strong wifi connection""...lol...I'm not 12....updated, still beyond slow",2025-05-20,1
"Account sync is NOT in real time. Timeline is completely off. none of my receipts match up to the bank summary!!! A company took money out of my account unauthorized, keyBank was made aware of the situation and still charged me late fees. I have a key bank for years and I never overdraft. Not happy.",2025-05-20,1

"I have been unable to use the zelle function for over 5 months now. I have tried going back to previous versions of the app and updating to the newest version with no luck. zelle is really the only reason I use the app at all other than the occasional balance check. I have had to use the website to send money over zelle and every time I do I have to sign in again, do a 2fa text for my key account and then another 2fa text for zelle. This issue alone is making me consider changing banks",2025-05-18,1
"I'll never understand why this app never works. 3 phones in 5 years, had the app 3 different times and it never works. Can't ever get past the Hello screen. I had to download ANOTHER app just to check my bank account balance because I can't even use the the banking app for my bank.",2025-05-17,1

"Let me take a screenshot if I want to... It's my phone, my security.",2025-04-30,1
This app never works. Maybe 1 out of ten times I try to open it the app it opens. Very frustrating when im trying to see how much I have in checking or if I need to transfer money to checking and it won't open. update: I did delete the app and reinstall. It seemed to work good for a few days only. Back to the same thing. I've been trying several times now right now to open the app and nothing!,2025-04-27,1
"TRASH TRASH TRASH Slow AF, freezes randomly, useless alerts that don't even work (and why is there no minimum account balance alert?), and why the hell did you remove the memo line from transfer on both website AND app?!",2025-04-27,1

deposit a check feature never working for me,2025-04-22,1
they keep shutting my card off and it disrupts my stuff for payments,2025-04-21,1
There are always issues online with banking with Key. And they are rarely explained unless you call. Now the don't even let you know if they don't make a payment for whatever reason. I'll be switching banks when my home equity is paid off.,2025-04-21,1
it never loads! come on plz fix this it used to be good!,2025-04-19,1
"Recently it just won't let you sign in. So it's completely useless. I cleared the data, restarted, re installed. Every option. It just asks for a login, then sends a code, then gives up and says the login isn't right.",2025-04-17,1

"Darn thing never opens anymore. Useless if you can't check your balances on the go. Will be uninstalling. Never have this problem with the other 3 banking apps I use. update:4/11/25 Still experiencing the same problem. It still is hit or miss if this app will even open. I uninstalled, reinstalled,reset phone (galaxy S 25 ultra)and still get stuck at the hello screen. Not one other banking app i use has this problem. But this problem has been going on for months with no fix. Very frustrating",2025-04-13,1
"Key Bank app didn't transfer my notifications when getting a new phone, installing and signing into the app so I missed important account notices and they only refunded 2/4 subsequent fees. The free checking account I've had for probably 15 years just started randomly charging me $7 monthly fees for not meeting an activity threshold on the account that didn't exist when I opened the account. We'll see if they'll refund those but I'm definitely leaving KeyBank. Shady, shady grubbers.",2025-04-09,1
"Seriously, how can such an important app be so bad? It doesn't even open most of the time, and yes, my phone and the app are updated to their latest software versions.",2025-04-08,1
Horrible experiences at Canandaigua and Auburn Branch. Tellers lied to me about the max amount of a check you can cash at both branches. 23 years I've had the account. I'm not trusting KeyBank with my money and neither should anyone else. Called customer service and they stated there is no max amount of a check. KeyBank check being deposited into KeyBank account and gotta wait for the funds to clear. Absolutely ridiculous to be lied to. Do not trust KeyBank tellers. They make there own rules!!!,2025-04-08,1
the app sucks and so does the physical bank itself.,2025-04-07,1

I can't receive push notifications,2025-04-05,1
"The fact that I cannot download and print off pages of my own banking history without having to contact a branch just to have them question me why I need my own personal data and then have to explain to them why I need specific dates for my own data is appalling. This is ridiculous, they do not need to know any of this whatsoever, IT IS MY DATA!! This needs to be fixed, there is no reason why they have to know every aspect of my personal life!!! *Update - Specific dates, not a basic statement",2025-04-05,1
"can't even log into the mobile App! will have me log on, then takes me to the browser, sign in and verify SSN, plug in code then it keeps circling back around. worst app I've ever tried using",2025-04-04,1
"updated review. Why do you insist on being the way that you are? Gosh this app is the worst. Every time they make an ""improvement"" they break something. This isn't rocket surgery, guys. Since the last update, I don't get any push notifications. I have cleared the cache, uninstalled, reinstalled, reset my phone, shut off the individual alerts and turned them back on. You really should fire, immediately, everyone even remotely related to this app. This garbage has been going on for years.",2025-04-04,1

"app is super slow takes forever to load up. I have top tier internet and a brand new device. takes forever to load and app had a delay compared to computer. I love Keybank service, but the app is archaic. Most frustrating app Ive dealt with compared to other banks.",2025-03-31,1
did everything they say still freezes up also. found out this bank holds checks after they have been deposited. supposed to receive it n last Wednesday of month talked to ss and they said it's your bank that holds it for three or four days. not them telling you to.,2025-03-31,1
It's not really secure,2025-03-30,1

"Non functional for multiple users with access to the same account. I've put in tickets with customer service, but it looks like I'm going to have to wait for the primary account holder to die before I can successfully get access without his login credentials. (Which he has given me freely) Edit: the response below has been reviewed and found to be not accurate",2025-03-22,1
This ap is very slow and often will not even open. I have to try to open it SEVERAL TIMES to get to my account.,2025-03-20,1
I hate you,2025-03-20,1

"""Not compatible with your device anymore"". Am I supposed to buy a new phone just because your developers fail to make a compatible app update?..",2025-03-06,1
half the time you can't get the app to load to the login screen. You have to have great signal to use the app. I stopped using key bank all together because of this.,2025-03-05,1
Update 3/5/25 I did all of what you ask and it works 25% of the time. Im done. Changing banks and closing my accounts. Won't open Once I went and got a new phone the app won't work.

It keeps making me uninstall and re install. Or I get locked out,2025-03-05,1
"It hardly ever opens even with a new phone. I delete and load a new app. It's very discouraging when I want to bank. 3/5/25 update: I have a new phone, 3 weeks old and 1 day this app will open immediately and next I wait for ever and get nothing. Yes, I have cleared cache, data and reloaded app. Uggg.",2025-03-05,1
"App is getting stuck on the hello page. Called keybank support and they have no clue. Already did what they asked with zero results. Loaded unloaded app 5x. Cleared cache, restarted worth no results. After reading the other reviews there is clearly some bugs in this app version. So frustrating it is talking keybank tech support so long to fix. Update: In response to my review from keybank, what they suggest was already done. No vpn and did all those things suggested. No success.",2025-03-04,1

"Never have i had a banking app that was so slow to open and operate. Can't use any of it's features, crashes all the time, and when you need it most, fails you. The web browser portal is faster. I have a note 24 ultra so I know it's not my device. I've uninstall, re-installed. Checked my network. App is TERRIBLE. The zelle feature has the lowest daily limit I've ever seen, even after talking to a banker. Can't even check my balance without waiting forever. Better off using the website.",2025-03-01,1

garbage. Can't even open the app. Unacceptable and unexcusable in this day and age with such heavy reliance on technology and applications more specifically.,2025-02-26,1
"App doesn't open a lot of the time. The pay bill feature, doesn't actually send your payment right away. Keybank issues a paper check sends it causing payment to be late. I was charged a late fee by the electric company. App doesn't always show my correct balance. They want you to go paperless, yet they issue a paper check when I use paybill. Horrible!!",2025-02-26,1
Not loading to open,2025-02-26,1
"Similar to other reviews, the last update has made the app unusable. I have followed the directions of clearing cache, uninstalling, restarting and reinstall but it will still not start. Please provide the previous version of this app and take down the broken version.",2025-02-26,1

"I'm in a looping hell of trying to log in, which launches the browser, which asks for security information, which I then provide. Then it asks for a passcode that it sends to my phone, which I also provide. After accepting all of this, it then tells me to navigate back to the app so that I can finish the login. And then, instead of allowing me access to my account, it repeats the cycle ALL OVER AGAIN. The third time I just threw my hands up and uninstalled. Just garbage, and an awful experience.",2025-02-15,1

"Does not work on android 16. Crashes after login. Also KeyBank seems to collect and share ALL of my data... It's 2025 for Christ sake, stop selling data, you're not a data broker. You're a bank. Do bank stuff. Edit: still not working, not the first time the issue has came about. I just removed the app! Honestly, institutions need to stop sharing data or they're going to lose customers. Encrypting with 128 just slows down hackers by a few seconds and you're sharing all that data constantly",2025-02-08,1
Won't load while I'm international while every single other app does. My card is locked and I cannot access it because the mange card section refuses to load.

App doesn't open... Freezes at screen with Key logo. Tried reinstalling and clearing cache.,2025-02-07,1
"This application through Google is disappointing. Depositing checks and other transactions are difficult, especially when the process keeps changing! This makes it extremely cumbersome and time consuming.

This bank is always playing with my finances and the app fails multiple times a year . When you have an issue that rarely can ever fix it without treating you like a criminal.

"Key Bank app didn't transfer my notifications when getting a new phone, installing and signing into the app so I missed important account notices and they only refunded 2/4 subsequent fees. The free checking account I've had for probably 15 years just started randomly charging me $7 monthly fees for not meeting an activity threshold on the account that didn't exist when I opened the account. We'll see if they'll refund those but I'm definitely leaving KeyBank. Shady, shady grubbers.",2025-04-09,2

Horrible experiences at Canandaigua and Auburn Branch. Tellers lied to me about the max amount of a check you can cash at both branches. 23 years I've had the account. I'm not trusting KeyBank with my money and neither should anyone else. Called customer service and they stated there is no max amount of a check. KeyBank check being deposited into KeyBank account and gotta wait for the funds to clear. Absolutely ridiculous to be lied to. Do not trust KeyBank tellers. They make there own rules!!!,2025-04-08,2

It will occasionally open to show my balance, but I can't open anything further then at some point it will say ""incident number"", display a bunch of random letters and numbers, then give the phone # for tech support. You call tech support, they tell you to uninstall, reinstall, and clear the cache. Worthless.",2024-11-13,2
All the sudden it's not compatible with my phone. So disappointed with Keybank.,2024-11-13,2
Apparently its magically no longer compatible with my phone. Wiah yall would have told me! Edit: You say 9.0 and thats what my phone is running and its STILL telling me my phone is not supported. I got now warning or anything about it being dropped! A warning would yavw been nice.,2024-11-13,2

This review is for the bank itself. I literally can't do anything with MY money. I need to transfer money onto my Cashapp card? Declined. Want to make a deposit onto DraftKings or FanDuel/Mohegan? Declined. What's the point of an account I can't transfer money out of?,2024-11-06,2
Only works about half the time. Faster to just go to the full website,2024-11-03,2

Unsophisticated Bank they rely almost exclusively on someone having a phone for verification I lost my cell phone and it was a nightmare trying to do my banking. They need to have other better ways for verification,2024-10-16,2

Zelle never loads I have to do it online so what's the point of the app??,2024-10-01,2
This bank is always playing with my finances and the app fails multiple times a year . When you have an issue that rarely can ever fix it without treating you like a criminal. Checking my balance shouldn't take me 40 clicks and 60 min. Unfortunately they are big in Seattle. I would literally put my money in my mattress instead. the app flags you for spending way too much,2024-09-29,2

This bank is always playing with my finances and the app fails multiple times a year . When you have an issue that rarely can ever fix it without treating you like a criminal.

This bank is always playing with my finances and the app fails multiple times a year . When you have an issue that rarely can ever fix it without treating you like a criminal.

"Does not work on android 16. Crashes after login. Also KeyBank seems to collect and share ALL of my data... It's 2025 for Christ sake, stop selling data, you're not a data broker. You're a bank. Do bank stuff. Edit: still not working, not the first time the issue has came about. I just removed the app! Honestly, institutions need to stop sharing data or they're going to lose customers. Encrypting with 128 just slows down hackers by a few seconds and you're sharing all that data constantly",2025-02-08,5
Won't load while I'm international while every single other app does. My card is locked and I cannot access it because the mange card section refuses to load.

I cannot believe app developers still do this with updates, and personally I'm dropping any apps that do this for mobile web browsers that do not lose login credentials ever. It's an unfortunate lack of foresight .",2024-11-19,5
It's ok,2024-11-19,5
"have to open then close the app for the sign in page to show, then wait for pin page to load. ordered checks & new card, both had problems. i never received the checks in my mailbox, was sent back & i didnt send it back. ordered another but did not get charged, used my 1st payment. they sent 1st card, lost in tracking so sent nother card urgent. got 2nd card, then week and half later recieved 1st card i ordered.",2024-10-26,5

site is easy but seems to frequently not be operating,2024-08-03,5
App crashes or is unavailable early in the morning.,2024-07-27,5
The app is alright. Their promotions are a joke. It's been 4 mo. Supposed to get $25 for opening a savings account. Nothing. Must have to let them take their fee of transferring savings into checking to equal that amount first.. beware from $1-$4 I've been charged to move money. Not the bank for poor ppl,2024-07-13,5
slow,2024-07-04,5
the app is mediocre and the bank itself is awful. $7 transfer fee between your own accounts is wild.,2024-07-02,5
The mobile check deposits function needs refinement. The amount of phone flipping and twisting required is better suited to solving a Rubiks cube.,2024-06-25,5

"The app works most of the time but is often buggy and I either have to continuously restart my phone or use the website instead. Update 3/9/25: The bugs in this app have never been fixed. Every single morning I have to restart my phone because the app says there has been a security issue and the account is locked. Once I restart, it's mostly fine for the rest of the day but this is an aggravating issue that's been ongoing for 3 years. Do better KeyBank.",2025-03-09,5

"I really like this app and use it a lot. However, just recently, the app keeps crashing. I have cleared the cache, unistalled, and re-installed several times. I really rely on this app for my banking, and this is a huge inconvenience. The only Key Bank branch near me is a 20 min drive away and us not always convenient to go to.

"For a chain bank company my local branch here in Adrian is very personal and helpful. Customer support is top notch and the online banking and app gives you complete control of everything to do with your money. I only have one complaint, thus the missing star. No matter how many weeks in a row I deposited my paycheck, they only give you access to a portion of it until the next day or so, even when the check clears week after week.",2024-09-21,5

have a hard time logging in with password,2024-07-18,5
"great for a banking app, a few things I find annoying but overall does the job for daily use. complaints cant rearrange accounts in the app or online. changing account titles is per account and doesn't transfer to the key Bank system. this makes walking into the bank to deposit or withdraw a pain if you have multiple accounts as you need to specify the account you want by last 4 digits. the transfer feature is hidden behind a drop down with Zelle being first.",2024-06-26,5
"Over 5 yrs, this has been a clean, simple app. Just in past month I've had the same issues posted by others: Freezing, stopping, can't sign in-says ""unable to use try back later"". Also, I've never had issued with fingerprint on any apps-this past month fingerprint has been glitchy. I had to go online & make a password. AND...not getting all alerts signed up for since a month ago (alerts only when card is used, not when items post to account). Please fix these issues! This is my 'go to' app!",2024-06-14,5
"EDIT: App has been working much better, not causing the login issue! Randomly logs you out and makes you type in even your user id again. If you fail finger print a couple of times it also locks your account. Security is overkill making you enter info again and again.",2024-06-14,5
