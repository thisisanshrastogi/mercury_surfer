Zelle is broken after update. Used to work fine on this device!,2025-05-23,1
I am unable to sign in over the past few weeks. I tried multiple times. I changed my pw and re installed the app,2025-05-22,1
"App had worked just fine for a few months, but all went down hill when I stopped getting alerts in my texts whenever money was put in or taken out of my account. Worst of all I can't even sign in on the app anymore, I've re downloaded the app multiple times just for it to say something along the lines of couldn't sign in try again later and something about trying again when I have internet when I literally have my internet connected. Great app until now.",2025-05-19,1
alright where do I start? the security of this bank is actually one of the worst out there. they are constantly getting leaked and thats why alot of you are dealing with fraud issues. on top of that their fraud customer support agents BARELY speak English. do yourselves a favor and go find a different bank. Huntington is a scam.,2025-05-19,1
can't get to my credit card information local branch is so rude that I would not go back,2025-05-16,1
errors out when anyone tries to log in,2025-05-14,1
The random days where they take all of the non Huntington ATM transaction fees all at once. I'm going back to Citi.,2025-05-14,1
Has been fine until most recent update. Now the app won't even open. Please fix!,2025-05-13,1

"I had a fraud prevention case on my debit card and had to cancel it. this was on Sunday. They said it would take 3-5 business days for a new card unless I wanted to pay an extra 25 dollars for expedited delivery. Business day number 5 comes and still no card. when I call them to find out why, they said it's 3-5 days from when they decide to process the new card. for some reason, they felt they could just wait until Wed (day 3) to ship it leaving me no access to my money for over a week.",2025-05-09,1
worst bank there is,2025-05-09,1
"This is thee worst app ever, all I wanted to do was make a car payment. App deleted.",2025-05-09,1
"Not customer friendly. Each and Every time not allowed access/ quick view etc., without issues. 00000+0 horrible",2025-05-08,1
all the 5 stars are paid for this app is absolute trash and Huntington bank is the worst i wish tcf never sold to them,2025-05-07,1

"app doesn't work half the time, not an internet issue",2025-05-07,1
"Update: Update: I can't sign in even though I changed my PW, keeps telling me something went wrong, and it won't let me log on. I've updated everything. Still, nothing helps, I've even Uninstalled it and reinstalled it. This is getting ridiculous, can't access my account. It has since improved. I can't give you a star rating because there are still issues, but not nearly as bad as it used to. It keeps rejecting my password and keeps kicking out my fingerprint.",2025-05-07,1
"horrible app, aside from the other already stated complaints (transfers not going through, balances dipping into the negative out of nowhere, I have overdraft turned off so not sure how that happens) recently I haven't even been able to login bc of ""internet connection. doesn't matter where I am or if I'm next to the router. I do not know what else to do at this point.",2025-05-07,1
Worst bank ever I can not wait to ditch this damn bank I was supposed to have gotten paid yesterday and here it is almost Friday and still no paycheck HERE WE GO AGAIN ALMOST 7AM ON SUNDAY AND THE APP IS STILL DOWN!!!!!! YOU GUYS NEED TO CHANGE THIS EVERY SUNDAY THING TO MAYBE ONLY 1 OR 2 TIMES A MONTH,2025-05-04,1
This app used to work great for me. Now most of the time all I get is a green screen and I can't log in. Very upsetting because I used to like this app for checking my account balance and making deposits. Now I can't do anything. Now it's not even letting me transfer funds from my checking account to my savings account. This app is losing its favor,2025-05-02,1
"All I need is Huntington app installed on my phone, your garbage does not gibe what I need",2025-04-25,1
very bad expirance,2025-04-25,1
"This app desperately needs a redesign, it's so clunky (much like the rest of the Huntington experience)",2025-04-20,1
"I will be closing all of my accounts due to not being able to access my account on a regular basis. your maintenances are ridiculous. There is not a single banking app, or any type of app for that matter, as awful as yours.",2025-04-20,1
"I have had this app for a couple of years, and as of recently I have had to reset my password for an unknown reason, and then when I tried to create a new password, I received the message that my request couldn't be honored. I can't even login at all to see what my account balance is! This is beyond frustrating!!",2025-04-16,1
bring back the old app. this new one isn't capable with my phone 😢🤬.,2025-04-14,1
"Zero information about required residency before downloading. It's called ""national"" bank, what a joke",2025-04-12,1
i would give no stars..the bank and its app...let's say Monday you purchase something for $20 and on app it shows ypu spent $20 on Monday but the place (amazon) doesn't take it physically until Wed it changes to show wednesday so you cant keeptrack of money(money there then maybe not). Credit card well if you send money from debit to credit in their same bank and app it can take 3-5 days but they take it instantly. nothing but attitude everyone you talk to and the standby cash Noone can help,2025-04-07,1
"Love the app for the most part. But, when it comes to the budgeting tools it's rarely available.",2025-04-04,1
terrible experience,2025-04-03,1
"mobile deposit crashes the app, please look at credit unions instead everyone.",2025-04-02,1
The bank picks and chooses who they breach their end of their account contracts with. My experience with Huntington Bank has not been a good one. I will be closing my account and start using a digital bank.,2025-04-01,1
"It was working fine for depositing checks over the past year, but about 2 months ago, it stopped letting me deposit checks. Ech time that I now press the ""deposit"" tab, it locks up, gives me the same ""service is currently not available "" message, and makes me log back into the app. I'm on a galaxy s21 phone.",2025-03-30,1
"""Zelle doesn't work on modified devices. Update or install default operating system"" This app is otherwise completely redundant. Huntington's website allows everything the app does.. except for Zelle. That's the only point to this app. I can't use it without reflashing my phone's ROM. Not happening.",2025-03-27,1
I've been a customer since 2013 but somehow my accounts were covered to platinum at a rate of $300 a year per account. Be careful using Huntington.,2025-03-27,1
horrible,2025-03-26,1
latest update on 3/22/35 messed up credit card payments.,2025-03-22,1

had this app for years now it says it's not compatible to my device and I can't look at my account anymore . It says I need to upgrade my app but can't upgrade either . What the hell is going on here ?,2025-03-18,1
App continues to have problems. facial recognition login hasn't worked in months now. S23 Ultra with all latest updates and fresh installs. Going to try dei stalling and reinstalling the app AGAIN. fresh I stall and now it just gets stuck when trying to approve face ID and Fingerprint ID acceptance. how pathetic can this be? I am getting to the end of patience with this back and am likely leaving to another bank.,2025-03-18,1
"galaxy note10 no longer supported, useless",2025-03-18,1
They decided that my phone is no longer supported by this app. Why should I have to spends hundreds just for an app I only use for one basic feature that should NEVER require buying a new phone for. I'm uninstalling.,2025-03-17,1
Says not compatible with my phone anymore. No similar ones to use either,2025-03-17,1

Now unable to use unless I purchase new phone. No longer compatible om your device. Am a senior on limited budget. I rely on access to account when making purchases. I don't have funds to run out and purchase new phone. NOT HAPPY!!!,2025-03-15,1

The new update is not working for my phone,2025-03-14,1
I had to update my banking app and when i tried it deleted the app and said it wasnt compatible with my phone. This sucks i already had the app on my phone.,2025-03-14,1
"Well, it was a good app for the past 8 years when it worked. Now, I can't even use it anymore, because you suddenly decided to add ""Update to use the app"" - however, I CANT UPDATE IT ANYMORE, because you suddenly decide that anybody with an older device, low income, that cant afford a new one like the corporate executives making this decision, should be locked out of their accounts! This is completely wrong and pathetic. IDC if the newest version works on my device, LET ME USE WHATS INSTALLED!!",2025-03-14,1
Can't update,2025-03-14,1
They're a bunch of crooks and liars. I really would not recommend this bank to anyone. Get away from this bank as fast as you can!,2025-03-13,1
Started my own business use this as my bank and the checks that were given to me by a client or not allowed to be deposited Under Suspicion of fraud or a high risk so needless to say I lost my payment my client was unable to pay me so I was unable to pay the people I hired to help me Huntington himself said they're going to close my account and yet it's still open negative,2025-03-13,1
You don't text me for hackers anymore. I'm not happy. 3 months now you have allowed a hacker to take 3.50 from your drive thru ATM. Why are you not protecting like all other banks do. I'm so mad at you because you don't protect me. I'm gonna look for a different trusted bank. Also Greenville MI bank never calls back and never answer phone. This is NOT HOW YOU RUN A BUSINESS,2025-03-12,1
So stupid I can't enroll more than 1000 with zelle transfers hate I wish they could fix this:/,2025-03-12,1
One of the worst bank experience imo,2025-03-11,1
App keeps crashing once it gets to the disclosure screen,2025-03-11,1
"I forgot my password and have been trying to reset my password for the last week or so but everytime I receive the same message of ""Unexpected error, please try again later"" I called customer support and they were no help, I need to actually go to a branch and get it manually changed there. Ridiculous.",2025-03-09,1
"I hate it. Slow, takes forever to open, extra unnecesary steps, always ""running out time"" even I closed it and waited. Is the worst app I ever used",2025-03-08,1
Insanely difficult to redeem rewardst,2025-03-07,1
The new update took away the ability to see your current balance including overdraft! 😤,2025-03-07,1
"""Love knowing where your money is? Wrong bank! lmao get cucked"" - the entire company",2025-03-06,1
Don't bank with this bank they will use your money to pay for a company that you did not want to pay and pay it anyway then you owe your bank money. Scam bank been with them sent they started and they don't care about you as a customer or how long you been with them.,2025-03-05,1
Hands down the worst bank. Made payments and they kept adding money to my loan. Called to figure it out and they hung up immediately.,2025-03-05,1
Well I accidentally wrote a check for a bill pay... I forgot to cancel it so now they took my online access away and I'm 100 mi from home working with no gas in my truck... After I verified my ID and everything with the call back it should be back when this is ridiculous,2025-03-05,1
"I've banked with many banks, this one decides to close your account randomly with no warning. Go bank with chase if you want to actually have security to your money.",2025-03-05,1
I still don't understand why I can't screenshot MY account information on MY device... this is dumb,2025-03-05,1
Simple but very inconsistent. App glitches more often than not when I try to make loan payments. Another issue caused one of my larger payments to duplicate. Bad app that honestly gives a lot of grounds to sue Huntington. Do not use it or Huntington if you have other options available.,2025-03-04,1
"Constantly under ""maintenance"" so if you keep your card locked you will not be able to unlock it. They do this all the time.",2025-03-02,1
"Can't ever access my money this is the 8th time so now I'm suing you.a business owner like me don't have time for this bs Huntington should know better.shame on you! Now $4,500 just disappeared and can't access either of my two accounts huntington says I don't have an account",2025-03-01,1
"Not a good experience. First of all it's hard to sign in and I kept updating it but is the same situation and even after I signed in, it showed me "" something went wrong"" so I couldn't see my bank accounts. They should fix this problem, it goes on and on for too long, also after the manager at Huntington made me opened a checking account besides the money market account, she told me that after 90 days I'll receive $ 400 money into my checking account but it never happened. What kinks of bankers",2025-02-28,1
"Have had my account go negative 4 times in the last 3 weeks due to the absurd amount of time it takes huntington to process transactions. I have email alerts for every transaction, and they still find a way to order transactions to make it go negative. This the only account I have problems with. Theu used to be awesome when I first switched from 53. Ive canceled my direct deposit with huntington. Use cashapp or similar. Huntington ain't it.",2025-02-27,1
"Watch your account the alerts they send are not accurate with what's happening with your account. Just because the alert says the money has been taken out, your account even says the money has been taken out that don't mean that they processed and took the money",2025-02-26,1
Can't login. Screen does nothing no matter if I login with thumb or face recognition. What's going on?,2025-02-24,1
The app and the bank exist in the past.,2025-02-20,1
Opened an account and they closed it once I got my card in the mail.,2025-02-19,1
Huntington bank stole 1000$ from my business checking account. Would not recommend this bank.,2025-02-14,1
Literally the worst bank and worst app ever. It doesnt let me connect to external banking accounts on this app. What a joke.,2025-02-13,1
New update does not load mobile deposit. I've sent emails about this with no response. Main reason why I use the app.,2025-02-12,1
Locked out of account continuously while trying to set up on line access with new account. Told I have to wait til tomorrow. Huntington doesn't make things easy. My credit union is so much better to deal with,2025-02-10,1
"Update: it's now February, and the problem is worse than ever. I called the help number they provided me here, they didn't know what I was saying. I made a purchase 2 weeks ago, took the money, put it back, took the money again, a week later put it back. I'm switching backs. This is ridiculous. 9/38/24: There's been 3 times in the last 2 months, that they randomly put money back into my account after it's been taken out. Then it gets retaken out 2 days later.",2025-02-10,1
"The app works well, but if they suspect any fraud they will lock the account until you see a teller. This is terrible for travelers.",2025-02-06,1
"I hate when I make a payment on my credit it shows no indication on the app that money was posted to my credit card or even being processed, pending, or nothing. My money is just floating around somewhere in space and I don't even know if my bill will be paid. I hate not knowing, please fix. My other bank posts payments right away or let me know I made a payment to my card. Why can't Huntington?",2025-02-05,1
"I have been trying for about 1/2 hour to be able to use this Zelle, and it referred me to Huntington, and there is NO information on the Huntington webpage that shows a direct link to using the Zelle. When I used the ""contact us"" option, all it did was take me to how to sign up with Zelle, which I already did before they consolidated and I have no way that shows me how to access the Zelle from the Huntington App, or Webpage.",2025-02-04,1
So many issues all in all. To this bank any transaction is fraudulent. If you need to make payments by zelle you always have your account locked. I do not recommend this bank. I m giving 1star because I have no option for 0,2025-01-22,1
Bank sucks. App sucks. Can't wait to switch here soon!,2025-01-20,1
"Why does this app still close after a certain time, my app should be available to me at all hours of the day. Such a horrible app to access during my time if day. Dropping it to one star because I've complained about this in the past and it still didn't let me into it at night when I need to because it's always down for scheduled maintenance. Worst bank app around.",2025-01-19,1

Get rid of your pending transaction hate it . Stop sending me fake fraud emails !! Noticed today that my balance when I clicked on quick balance form sign in page wasnt the same when I logged in. Not seeing my rent that I paid yesterday,2025-01-04,1
Biometric hasn't worked since last update.,2025-01-03,1

"DO NOT USE THIS BANK IF YOU NEED YOUR MONEY!! I've had nothing but issues with this bank. Couldn't use my debit card for over a month, then every time I add money, they take it. Worse bank I've ever used in my life",2024-12-30,1
You should know Enough.,2024-12-30,1
"No longer compatible with my device???!!! Why keep my money in a bank, that I'm unable to use conveniently?",2024-12-30,1
Can't save password on Android. Can't use biometrics in app unless biometrics are enabled for entire Android phone. C'mon huntington. You're security measures are ridiculous and no one else is doing this.,2024-12-27,1
How many time do I have to re register the same devices???? Fix this junk.,2024-12-26,1
I don't like changes. If it works. Don't fix it.,2024-12-26,1
Not being able to pay off my car loan from my check account balance seems like a pretty basic option than in unable to do. When I try to pay my car loan it makes me use an external which I just put in my Huntington account to pay it off. Now one been doing this the past 4 months now and actually missed a payment this month from the total inconvenience. I've rarely missed any payments but for me to be late because of a design flaw in your app is totally unacceptable. I will be transferring banks,2024-12-26,1

App could and should be better by a multibillion dollar corporation!!!,2024-12-16,1

Buffering . Won't open,2024-12-10,1
This app used to be good until they changed something. Now I have a weeks worth of pending items and not sure what my balance is. Grrrrrr,2024-12-09,1
Always has a maintenance at random time and doesn't alert you before doing it,2024-12-08,1
Ok,2024-12-07,1

"By far thee worst app I've EVER had. It regularly freezes or like now just stops completely. The last few days has just been a completely black screen! That's a new one. It's incredibly inconvenient to need to check your account while out shopping & have a useless app. Match that with the fact that the ATMS near me also notoriously don't work! Oh, & Zelle has NEVER worked for me! Every month I swear I'm changing banks. I'm so frustrated with the electronic service issues from this company.",2024-12-02,1
Garbage app,2024-12-02,1
It won't open and let you check your bank account anymore.,2024-11-29,1
This is a horrible app. When I try to make a payment it keeps deleting the amount and flipping around. If I turn the screen sideways it allows the entry in the other amount field but then flashes and flips around then loses the entry. DELETE! I will refinance my vehicle with my own bank that has a reliable app,2024-11-28,1
"Shutting down your online banking every weekend is bad, I really need access to send money for an emergency and there is absolutely no way to get in and send money while under maintenance.. this has happened far too often",2024-11-24,1
Avoid this bank at all costs. As soon as you need help from a stolen account they are completely unavailable for assistance. Even TCF was better than this. Editing to keep the review updated. I have a brand new phone and the app still manages to not load all of the pages I would actually want to see.,2024-11-23,1

"Absolutely useless. After update (11/18/24) we can't use quick balance feature or log in. Error message about ""something gone wrong. Maybe you aren't connected to the internet. Try again later."" Unacceptable.",2024-11-18,1
"This is by far one of the most useless apps for banking.

i would give no stars..the bank and its app...let's say Monday you purchase something for $20 and on app it shows ypu spent $20 on Monday but the place (amazon) doesn't take it physically until Wed it changes to show wednesday so you cant keeptrack of money(money there then maybe not). Credit card well if you send money from debit to credit in their same bank and app it can take 3-5 days but they take it instantly. nothing but attitude everyone you talk to and the standby cash Noone can help,2025-04-07,2

Now, I can't even use it anymore, because you suddenly decided to add ""Update to use the app"" - however, I CANT UPDATE IT ANYMORE, because you suddenly decide that anybody with an older device, low income, that cant afford a new one like the corporate executives making this decision, should be locked out of their accounts!

You don't text me for hackers anymore. I'm not happy. 3 months now you have allowed a hacker to take 3.50 from your drive thru ATM. Why are you not protecting like all other banks do. I'm so mad at you because you don't protect me. I'm gonna look for a different trusted bank. Also Greenville MI bank never calls back and never answer phone.

Simple but very inconsistent. App glitches more often than not when I try to make loan payments. Another issue caused one of my larger payments to duplicate. Bad app that honestly gives a lot of grounds to sue Huntington. Do not use it or Huntington if you have other options available.,2025-03-04,2

First of all it's hard to sign in and I kept updating it but is the same situation and even after I signed in, it showed me "" something went wrong"" so I couldn't see my bank accounts. They should fix this problem, it goes on and on for too long, also after the manager at Huntington made me opened a checking account besides the money market account, she told me that after 90 days I'll receive $ 400 money into my checking account but it never happened. What kinks of bankers",2025-02-28,2
"Have had my account go negative 4 times in the last 3 weeks due to the absurd amount of time it takes huntington to process transactions.

It's a good bank and a pretty good app. My issue is the app icon strangely enough. It doesn't follow Androids standards. It's the square Huntington logo in a white circle. It looks out of place and ugly. It needs to follow Googles themed icon standards.,2024-11-28,2
Everytime i try to log in it says it seems I'm not connected to the internet and to try again later. I can try multiple times with the same message. I can go to other apps right after with no problem so it has to do with Huntington,2024-11-20,2

The app has been great The only thing that I think is pointless is your standby cash..you have to fall under so many qualifications in order to use it..but if I fell under all of those qualifications no overdraws keep at least $200 ect I wouldn't need the standby cash..You're pretty much waving 250 in my face and not allowing me to utilize that perk ..when I do need to use it I do pay it back in a timely manner if not earlier and you charge a fee now.. ease up on the qualifications...,2024-11-12,2

Their ATM operations are sub standard. The ATM machines themself are poorly lit it is difficult to see the buttons on the actual ATM much less personal security reasons. I travel often and see the issues between all the ATMs I visited. It is not uncommon for an ATM to be out of service or unavailable to accept deposits whether it be cash or check. Also if you have multiple transactions you have to remove your card and start over a second transaction. Bill counters often rejects bills repeatedly,2025-01-16,3
"Still giving this app 2 stars because for about 6 months now, the balance reflected in my account isn't always accurate.

It' seems to take day's to get your deposit if it is coming from MGM!,2025-01-23,3
Overall pretty satisfied with Huntington and the app but I travel a good bit and it's annoying that I can't deposit from a saved image. When a paper check is mailed to my home I could ask someone to send me pictures but that doesn't work. Also the dates of purchases are no where close to correct but that isn't necessarily on them.,2025-01-10,3

I am a 75 yr old who has been with your bank since Gary Zajak was in charge..it is very difficult for elderly to motivate around new phones as well as new changes with accounting systems...I know banks are continuing to update but for the elderly that makes it more difficult to navigate through the process...I guess its time to consider alternatives.,2024-10-25,3
For several months now I have had 1000 missing from my account each month. And even the app reflects the missing amount. Yet there are no purchases or transfers or anything showing.,2024-10-20,3

I made a payment for half of my total payment due 2 weeks before the actual due date. The payment went through and it shows it on the app but at the top it's still showing the payment amount to be the full amount. Can you guys change it to where that total decreases every time you make a payment? Because you got me over here thinking I still need to pay that amount even though I already payed half lol.,2024-10-04,3
I like the app that we can get paid a day or two in advance. I don't like it that some payments are electronic and some bills are paid with check by the bank and then my bill is late when it's the banks fault and I'm charged a late fee when I had paid it on time,2024-09-30,3

Ever since last update no longer receiving push notifications. Very frustrating. Looks like I am not the only one having this issue. I did get the email notifications to finally work.

Decent UI but still a very slow app and the tutorial screen pops up for me every time I open the app.,2024-08-24,3
I am very unhappy with this app. As soon as I download because I got a new phone and number the system logs me out and blocks my online access. I have to get someone to drive all the way to the bank or pay someone to take me. They do not tell you that all their perks require you be there 90 days before they MIGHT let you have them. They also say they offer you credit but there is nothing to check if you got it online or where it is paid. They charged me for checks I never got and won't refund,2024-08-20,3

"I do not like how they do things one day, showing stuff taking out, and then it disappears, and the dates have been changed to a recent date and subtracted. So if you had for an example $1000 and all dates were posted that was subtracted already but two days later, it shows $800, and the stuff that was subtracted days ago was moved to a recent date make it make sense. Like they purposely try to make you go in overdraft or something or pinching pennies. I got my eye on yall Huntington",2024-08-16,3

It works but any notification part of the app is worthless. I can't shut off email notifications its not an option they allow which is bs. They don't notify you of fees. They don't notify you of purchases at certain times. The only reason I even have this account is because Chime doesn't allow withdrawals for my mortage. Chime has a far superior app and notification experience.,2024-03-16,3

It keeps blacking out to where I can't access it.,2024-01-19,3
I like this app and use it alot its easy and works well. Mobile deposits are great! One huge problem however is debit card purchases randomly dissapear from pending and history only to re apear in a day or so? This happens too much and of course changes your balance. This is a horrible flaw that needs to be fixed immediately! No excuse for this!,2024-01-03,3

Their ATM operations are sub standard. The ATM machines themself are poorly lit it is difficult to see the buttons on the actual ATM much less personal security reasons. I travel often and see the issues between all the ATMs I visited. It is not uncommon for an ATM to be out of service or unavailable to accept deposits whether it be cash or check. Also if you have multiple transactions you have to remove your card and start over a second transaction. Bill counters often rejects bills repeatedly,2025-01-16,4
"Still giving this app 2 stars because for about 6 months now, the balance reflected in my account isn't always accurate. The app itself tells you that your balance displayed is what's left after pending transactions.

It' seems to take day's to get your deposit if it is coming from MGM!,2025-01-23,4
Overall pretty satisfied with Huntington and the app but I travel a good bit and it's annoying that I can't deposit from a saved image. When a paper check is mailed to my home I could ask someone to send me pictures but that doesn't work.

I am a 75 yr old who has been with your bank since Gary Zajak was in charge..it is very difficult for elderly to motivate around new phones as well as new changes with accounting systems...I know banks are continuing to update but for the elderly that makes it more difficult to navigate through the process...I guess its time to consider alternatives.,2024-10-25,4

I made a payment for half of my total payment due 2 weeks before the actual due date. The payment went through and it shows it on the app but at the top it's still showing the payment amount to be the full amount. Can you guys change it to where that total decreases every time you make a payment? Because you got me over here thinking I still need to pay that amount even though I already payed half lol.,2024-10-04,4
I like the app that we can get paid a day or two in advance. I don't like it that some payments are electronic and some bills are paid with check by the bank and then my bill is late when it's the banks fault and I'm charged a late fee when I had paid it on time,2024-09-30,4

Decent UI but still a very slow app and the tutorial screen pops up for me every time I open the app.,2024-08-24,4
I am very unhappy with this app. As soon as I download because I got a new phone and number the system logs me out and blocks my online access. I have to get someone to drive all the way to the bank or pay someone to take me. They do not tell you that all their perks require you be there 90 days before they MIGHT let you have them. They also say they offer you credit but there is nothing to check if you got it online or where it is paid. They charged me for checks I never got and won't refund,2024-08-20,4
"Unremarkable, and missing key banking features like setting up automatic payments. K major issues otherwise though, they just need to make some key updates.",2024-08-17,4
"I do not like how they do things one day, showing stuff taking out, and then it disappears, and the dates have been changed to a recent date and subtracted. So if you had for an example $1000 and all dates were posted that was subtracted already but two days later, it shows $800, and the stuff that was subtracted days ago was moved to a recent date make it make sense. Like they purposely try to make you go in overdraft or something or pinching pennies. I got my eye on yall Huntington",2024-08-16,4

It works but any notification part of the app is worthless. I can't shut off email notifications its not an option they allow which is bs. They don't notify you of fees. They don't notify you of purchases at certain times. The only reason I even have this account is because Chime doesn't allow withdrawals for my mortage.

I like this app and use it alot its easy and works well. Mobile deposits are great! One huge problem however is debit card purchases randomly dissapear from pending and history only to re apear in a day or so? This happens too much and of course changes your balance.

alright where do I start? the security of this bank is actually one of the worst out there. they are constantly getting leaked and thats why alot of you are dealing with fraud issues. on top of that their fraud customer support agents BARELY speak English. do yourselves a favor and go find a different bank.

Business day number 5 comes and still no card. when I call them to find out why, they said it's 3-5 days from when they decide to process the new card. for some reason, they felt they could just wait until Wed (day 3) to ship it leaving me no access to my money for over a week.",2025-05-09,5

This app used to work great for me. Now most of the time all I get is a green screen and I can't log in. Very upsetting because I used to like this app for checking my account balance and making deposits. Now I can't do anything.

Simple but very inconsistent. App glitches more often than not when I try to make loan payments. Another issue caused one of my larger payments to duplicate. Bad app that honestly gives a lot of grounds to sue Huntington. Do not use it or Huntington if you have other options available.,2025-03-04,5

Unacceptable, especially if you are traveling abroad and need to use your card, just for it to be locked. Be warned:you CANNOT unlock your card without visiting a branch",2024-10-11,5
"Forcing this update to use the app, I get it for security and potential better use of transactions and pending transactions which really is annoying bunched to one page.....but yet the spending analysis is still broken when trying to click each category it closes out back to the main screen all the time.

Good luck confirming it, the transfer might just disappear one moment and apply the next day (or the next business day, who knows?). Want to make any kind of payment? Good luck getting to the actual page to do so instead of a random error or a redirect to something unrelated.

Their ATM operations are sub standard. The ATM machines themself are poorly lit it is difficult to see the buttons on the actual ATM much less personal security reasons. I travel often and see the issues between all the ATMs I visited. It is not uncommon for an ATM to be out of service or unavailable to accept deposits whether it be cash or check. Also if you have multiple transactions you have to remove your card and start over a second transaction. Bill counters often rejects bills repeatedly,2025-01-16,5
"Still giving this app 2 stars because for about 6 months now, the balance reflected in my account isn't always accurate. The app itself tells you that your balance displayed is what's left after pending transactions. However, there's times I've spent something my balance says I have, and then a few hours later, get a notification my account is in the negative. For example, it could say I have $100, so I'll spend $50 and then it will say I am at -$10 as though I actually had $40 and not $100.",2025-01-11,5

It works but any notification part of the app is worthless. I can't shut off email notifications its not an option they allow which is bs. They don't notify you of fees.

"Not being able to screenshot my own banking/loan information is kind of stupid. Now instead of locked on my phone, it's written on a scrap of paper. I wonder which option is more secure in the end? Overall not the worst, but definitely far from the best app.",2024-03-13,5

Ok,2024-02-29,5
I have had problems with it,2024-02-25,5
Why don't you let me use the app abroad?,2024-02-13,5
I am overall satisfied with the app with the exception that ever since I switched from. Apple to android I can no longer have a widget. Is that not an option for androids??,2024-02-13,5
It keeps blacking out to where I can't access it.,2024-01-19,5
I like this app and use it alot its easy and works well. Mobile deposits are great! One huge problem however is debit card purchases randomly dissapear from pending and history only to re apear in a day or so? This happens too much and of course changes your balance. This is a horrible flaw that needs to be fixed immediately! No excuse for this!,2024-01-03,5
1/3 Update: I just reinstalled after a couple of months just to see and it does work now. 10/17 The app basically stopped working. Won't let me login,2024-01-03,5
"Recent changes to the app, seems to have removed the quick balance feature even though I still have it allowed in settings. I used that feature daily and it was my favorite feature of the app. Now it is no better than any other banking app.",2024-01-03,5

"Pretty decent app. My biggest complaint is that it has to offer to give me the ""walk through"" EVERY SINGLE TIME I log in. I've used the app for over two years...I've got it. No help is needed. I understand it should be there once Ive downloaded the app, heck even the first time I've logged in with a profile...or at least give me the option to turn it off.",2025-01-18,5
"The installed app icon don't look like the play store app icon, please fix. But other than that, I like the app",2025-01-04,5

"Pretty good app. I like being able to deposit checks on my phone. I like the budget features, but still not using it 100%. Overdraft loans should not be counted as income. Since the latest update, I can't see how much overdraft protection I still have. This is important. Please bring this back. Edit: I no longer see the scheduled activity tab. Where did that go? Also, when I double-click a budget category, it starts to load, but then immediately goes back to the main pie graph. I can't see them.",2024-09-30,5

"I love this app. I can transfer money between my Huntington accounts instantly, between accounts that aren't Huntington and see what I have at a glance.

Nice enough app interface. I don't like though when you can't chose to use a pin # for faster sign in. You need to type in your password every time. It doesn't even come up automatically like every other app. Regardless if you save it or not.,2024-03-22,5
Issues are few and far between but serious,2024-03-15,5

I've been on a bit of a strange journey with Huntington but I do believe they are a good bank.
