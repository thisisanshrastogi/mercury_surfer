"Used this app for years but it appears Regions only cares about their customers who have new phones. The fact that I've been a customer since before online banking doesn't matter. A heads up that they were going to screw over a bunch of us customers would've been nice. I've been unhappy with Regions in general for years but used them bc they're everywhere. Looks like its time to go to a bank that actually appreciates their customers, no matter their phone model.",2025-05-23,1
This stinks for those of us who may not have the latest phones! I'm certainly not going to go out and buy a new one just for Regions!,2025-05-22,1

"New* Will the great new app be backwards compatible for the Note9, among others? Why isn't this app compatible with the Samsung Note 9? Mine still functions as well as the day I first got it years ago. I have yet to use or try to use any app I've had an interest in that doesn't work for my device, until now. Am I supposed to buy a new $1000+ device just to meet the demands of every app developer that refuse to write, or is too lazy to write software that will cover a greater range of devices?",2025-05-20,1

app has not worked on my android phone for over 2 years,2025-05-20,1
regions why did you update the app so everyone couldn't use it,2025-05-20,1
"The update needs work with all phones, including Samsung Galaxy Note 9, or leave the Regions app the way it was without the update. When it worked with all phones. Google's Android update has made the Regions app user unfriendly / unusable. I hate not being able to use the app. It was my preferred way to access my account. When you contact Regions, they say it's the Google update; not Regions' doing.",2025-05-20,1

I can no longer use this app after many years of being able to because its no longer capatible with my Samsung 9+. I sent a complaint in to the bank and their reply was to update my operating system.

I gave the app 4 stars back in 2018 but now only 1. I've been using the app fine on my 9S+ but without any explanation I couldn't use the app anymore.

Regions bank app was working then Regions made it quit working. This was clearly to benefit Regions Bank rather than it's customers who actually used the app. I am currently Bank shopping for a new bank.,2025-04-30,1

"Been using this app for my Galaxy S 9 for 7 years now and suddenly says it's not compatible with my device and stopped working. Depending on the fix, this will determine where I move my accounts.

app and webpage have been giving the 4100 for the last 3 days. I can't pay my bills or make a deposit because of it. that's the whole reason I wanted to do online banking.

They upgraded the app and suddenly I can't use it on my phone. Thanks Regions. My phone is only a couple of years old. After over 20 years I've decided it's actually less expensive and less annoying to change banks than to change phones.,2025-04-24,1

these constant late fees of $36...plus the low interest rates,2025-04-23,1
"Regions... ""no longer compatible..."" Are you kidding me?! This is so ridiculous! From 5 STARS to 1 STAR. Your ""Security"" has some major flaws. During the Holidays it was NON-STOP issues with ""fraud prevention"" and freezing my account because I used MY ATM card to pay for MY purchase ....even paying my regular bills would freeze my account! NOW you're Security team has another bright idea! NO warning! We find out just in the midst of needing access we no longer have...BAD customer service!",2025-04-23,1

I'm having the same experience as everyone else where the app requires an update but says my device is not compatible. Two decades nearly I've been with Regions and have always been pleased but this is just not right. I understand security and digital safety but to basically shut out a large amount of customers who want to access their account online is a shame. It is a shame that no one considered the consequences of a decision like this. Maybe people can't afford or choose not to buy new devic,2025-04-04,1

I've used the banking app without any problems for several years and it worked great. Now it says I have to update the app but I get a message that it is no longer support with my S9+.

Was working fine hit suddenly stopped and appears to be in some sort of 2 factor authentication war with google.,2025-04-04,2
I'm having the same experience as everyone else where the app requires an update but says my device is not compatible. Two decades nearly I've been with Regions and have always been pleased but this is just not right. I understand security and digital safety but to basically shut out a large amount of customers who want to access their account online is a shame. It is a shame that no one considered the consequences of a decision like this. Maybe people can't afford or choose not to buy new devic,2025-04-04,2
I updated WEEKS ago and now the day is here and I'm locked out. frustrating is the least of my grievances. I been with regions for years and years.and.Inthink it's time for a change. As far as I'm concerned you dropped the ball not me.,2025-04-04,2

They upgraded the app and suddenly I can't use it on my phone. Thanks Regions. My phone is only a couple of years old. After over 20 years I've decided it's actually less expensive and less annoying to change banks than to change phones.,2025-04-24,3

"Pros: •They use Zelle as an option for external transfers (a lot of banks don't). •They give you time before charging overdraft fees & warn you ahead of time. Cons: •You can't transfer money from a savings acct to a checking acct unless you are overdrawn in the checking acct. •There's always issues with logging into the mobile bank app & it's very sensitive, which means you're constantly getting locked out of your acct for ""security"" reasons. •They are completely closed on Saturdays.",2025-04-30,3
Regions is a pretty good bank..except 2 yrs ago when my card was compromised in Vegas and they basically said I was lying and would not refund the money.

That's unfair to do an update that is aimed to support only new phones, not taking into consideration that everyone does not have new phones. You have the data to see the different versions of phones we have. You can't force people to get new phones just to use your app, that is inconsiderate. You will loose users because we will use the web.",2025-04-22,3

Worked just fine for years.. No longer compatible with a device that's not even 10 years old? Seems lazy and another reason to make people buy new things. Not happy at all,2025-04-05,4

"Don't know who screwed up with the compatibility list for your update but ""security and privacy"" isn't a good enough excuse. Never had a single problem using the app and now suddenly incompatible. This isn't a minor issue you can put on the backburner waiting to fix. Longer you wait the more customers you will lose. Fix or rollback until you can fix it.",2025-04-05,4

Was working fine hit suddenly stopped and appears to be in some sort of 2 factor authentication war with google.,2025-04-04,4
I'm having the same experience as everyone else where the app requires an update but says my device is not compatible. Two decades nearly I've been with Regions and have always been pleased but this is just not right. I understand security and digital safety but to basically shut out a large amount of customers who want to access their account online is a shame. It is a shame that no one considered the consequences of a decision like this. Maybe people can't afford or choose not to buy new devic,2025-04-04,4
I updated WEEKS ago and now the day is here and I'm locked out. frustrating is the least of my grievances. I been with regions for years and years.and.Inthink it's time for a change. As far as I'm concerned you dropped the ball not me.,2025-04-04,4

Two decades nearly I've been with Regions and have always been pleased but this is just not right.

"Oh, so now the new update isn't available for my device? Pray tell, what do I do now - switch banks?",2025-04-03,5
"With latest update the app became useless. Now it's not supported on older devices and the bank is forcing me to change my device. But since the bank does not offer mobile app to me, it is the bank that becomes useless. I'll change the bank before my device as I don't intend to pay $1k to get comparable quality.

I've used this app for years and now it is stating it is not compatible with my phone. I thought it was a glitch so I uninstalled the app to reinstall it and now I cannot. This is truly an inconvenience. I never had an issue with the app until now. I've seen other reviews were people are complaining about the same issue I'm having with no resolution. I will not upgrade my phone for this issue. I will consider another bank after years of being with Regions.,2025-04-03,5
I have had this app for a while now...worked fine. Recently had an update needed and now says my phone is not compatible with the app. I called Regions bank and they could not help me with it.,2025-04-03,5
"""Not compatible with your device""? What's up with that? My phone might be a few years old but how is it ok to make it so I can't download the update at all?! You're essentially forcing me to spend hundreds of dollars on a new phone if I want to continue banking on this app. ""Security and privacy"" bs",2025-04-03,5
Not very happy at the moment and I'm not able to access my account. App says update is required but app store says my device is not supported for an update.,2025-04-03,5

Edit: Got ahold of them and this version of the ""update"" isnt gonna be changed or reverted, its messed alot of regions employees to. They cant or wont change it back so were just gonna have to go through the website. Whatever was done isnt an update considering its effectively made it useless and incompatible with most devices. Even the banks are confused",2025-04-02,5
"It would have been nice to know yesterday that the app would require I buy a new phone today. I know I need one, I just bought one and gave it to my kid because his just broke. What I really super need is access to my account NOW.",2025-04-02,5

"locked out of the app. it says I have to update it in-app to log in, but the app store itself says it's no longer compatible with my device. I don't even have that old of a phone, so I don't see why my phone would not be able to use this app anymore. I literally can't see any purchase history or move any of my money without driving 20 mins to a physical location. if I could give 0 stars, I would. EDIT: worst bank I've ever dealt with. I'm switching ASAP. it's not even just the app.",2025-04-02,5

"The bank is fine as far as everyday use: ease of access via the phone app and online account, and also local offices if you need in-person service. Not so good if you need a loan: we've tried 3 times to get a loan to replace the roof on a property we own, agreed to Regions being 1st mortgage holder (we own the property outright); worked hard to raise our credit scores and pay down cards we had to use for repairs after the first time they turned us down; our scores are 711 & 754; still denied.",2025-05-04,5
Whst is going on wih this app? I hsve been trying to go into my account with no successs. Never had any problems before. What are we supposed to do? Nothing was sent to us about new app development or update. I hope I dont get charged for any overdrafts otherwise they will hear from the banking commission and possibly my lawyer.

why can't I sign on to my Regions app if there is a problem with my phone device how do I know what phone to upgrade to to accept the Regions app,2025-05-02,5
"I have used this for yrs and I rely on the app to pay my bills now its no longer compatible, why the change!?",2025-04-30,5
"Pros: •They use Zelle as an option for external transfers (a lot of banks don't). •They give you time before charging overdraft fees & warn you ahead of time. Cons: •You can't transfer money from a savings acct to a checking acct unless you are overdrawn in the checking acct. •There's always issues with logging into the mobile bank app & it's very sensitive, which means you're constantly getting locked out of your acct for ""security"" reasons. •They are completely closed on Saturdays.",2025-04-30,5
Regions is a pretty good bank..except 2 yrs ago when my card was compromised in Vegas and they basically said I was lying and would not refund the money. I was never even at the place where it was used. I googled the place to make sure. It was a Mexican restaurant that we never went to. But ok...,2025-04-28,5

"I have been using this app for years,with a galaxy note 9, that works perfect, now it's no longer compatible with my phone and to contacted the developer. That's unfair to do an update that is aimed to support only new phones, not taking into consideration that everyone does not have new phones. You have the data to see the different versions of phones we have. You can't force people to get new phones just to use your app, that is inconsiderate. You will loose users because we will use the web.",2025-04-22,5
Soooo.... I've been banking with Regions for almost 20 years. I got a Samsung Galaxy 9 from my daughter and I couldn't find it in the PlayStore. Went to the website to find out that my new phone isn't compatible with the app!!!! How come?,2025-04-21,5
"App was fantastic for years until the April 22 ,2022 security update. Since then it freezes, won't allow me to login most times. Tried uninstall - reinstall to no avail. Hopefully it will get fixed with the next update Wow, another update. Now the app is telling me it is no longer compatible with my phone. The app is the main reason I have the phone.

Why? it should still be compatible regardless, but I can't update it and the version I have won't allow me to log in because it's outdated. Please fix. I simply can't justify getting a new phone because your app forces me to. Your response didn't really help. if the update is pushed to phones with a certain android version then it should be compatible with that version",2025-04-06,5
"I don't even know what to rate this at. It was a 5 star until I opened the app today and the message showing was is, ""This phone of mine is no longer compatible with the Regions Bank app."" The app was working fine until today. Then to me it looked like it magically uninstalled itself. Maybe a 1 rating? I don't have a clue. 1 other question is there any Regions bank app version compatible with my phone now?
