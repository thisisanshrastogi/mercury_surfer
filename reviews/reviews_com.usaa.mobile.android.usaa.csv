I haven't been able to use my app for over a week. now. I've called & talked to tech. services for hours no luck. when I try to logon I hit the app & I get a logon page I push on blue strip & I get a White Page & nothing else.. I did everything I was told to do by tech. services. I uninstalled app several times all other apps are working. I've got a really good phone & have been with USAA for 14 years & never experienced anything like this. please HELP ME. Thank you Kat Losh. KATHERINE LOSH.,2025-05-23,1

Poor customer service.,2025-05-21,1
won't let me schedule and doesn't respond to me,2025-05-21,1
App is useless for claims process. you cannot upload photos and you cannot message your adjuster through the app despite it saying you can. when you click the message your adjuster button it simply redirects you to the homepage.,2025-05-21,1

"The customer service is horrible. After they raised my monthly payment by $150, I tried canceling my coverage. They asked me for a4 digit pin which I never used. I attempted the change my pin on the app and they instructed me to call customer service. Customer service then told me I could only change my pin if I provide them with my current pin. I spoke to 3 representatives and neither of them was able to assist me and they told me I could not cancel my coverage.",2025-05-19,1

the app has trouble loading after the login screen and loops back to re-login on a continuous loop.,2025-05-19,1
USAA keeps changing the app and the location of items (layout of it's app). It is very annoying. USAA has gone down hill the last 10 plus years. This is coming from a 20+ year member.,2025-05-18,1
"this mobil app is no good can not get on it, and there is no place where i can deposit my check",2025-05-18,1
I tried to recover my password and online ID with the text link and never got anything. I had to figure out my login because your app wouldn't send me the info even though I had all my info right. Luckily I remembered what both were after some time. Tried two different days to get it to work. Also lucky I still had another device with my info saved.,2025-05-17,1
The app keeps requesting updates and is always down for maintenence when you need to transfer.,2025-05-17,1
"Woman with no licence hits me. her insurance...geico...says they cant get in contact with her, so they're denying responsibility. usaa, my insurance, tells me because of that, i need to pay for my own repair",2025-05-16,1

Not Happy With USAA bills are always high no matter what you do so pretty much you have to get the lowest insurance possible in order to afford the insurance and make your payments on time thumbs down üëéüèΩ,2025-05-16,1

"I've had so much trouble with my accounts, on one occasion my account was taken over by an outside entity, and my accounts were cleaned out. Usaa never paid back",2025-05-16,1
It keeps asking me to review and I hate that. One star.,2025-05-15,1
This app is the worst thing about USAA. Why can't I just log on and use an authentication code like most secure apps. Seem like some moron wants to reinvent the wheel with some twisted sequence of switcharoos to keep you confused. good thing the web page is still normal.,2025-05-15,1

This app is so unreliable it is downright terrifying. I would love to know why my security settings change every 15 minutes??? It is 12:30 in the afternoon and I have already had to allow permissions for my widget 8 times (A issue that has been going on with the widget for a year and a 1/2 now and you refuse to fix it) and reset my biometrics 3 times. Your system is not secure. I'm moving all my money to Chase. Venmo is more secure than this! I'm done!!,2025-05-14,1
"Big company with a horrible LOW end web site and app. Incompetence; NOT having the ability to pay personal and business accounts separately. USAA charges a fee for something the customer CAN'T do because BUSINESS funds require separation. The customer also doesn't get the discounts they FASLELY advertise. USAA constantly contacts YOU (emails, mail) to ADD stuff for your business then charges fees. USAA wants paperless but mails a million flyers.",2025-05-14,1

"The updates essentially brick the device until you comply. Not cool. Update 12.11 24 they just disabled my device app all together now. Was working fine, but now not working at all. This is ridiculous and should be illegal. I paid for this service in one way or another. They should be made to account. 5.13.25 another update! this is honestly on purpose. taking your personal info and then getting ""hacked"". stop it or I'll get another bank",2025-05-13,1

"App is incompatible with my device after the last update. This is a classic example of corporations gatekeeping technology and its just the beginning folks.

I called tech support and the Rep just states it is now required. It makes no sense. And if there was a change, user's should've been notified. Going down hill fast. This app used to be great.

"The UI is so counter-intuitive, I'm considering switching insurance providers because of it. Links from emails turn into a non-stop loading page that can't be used, and clicking that tempting little X in the corner of the app nearly always closes the entire app instead of getting me back to any useful page.

For starters USAA doesnt look at any of these reviews. They are just for the Play Store.. Yet again! ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è The latest app update information CLEARLY states. My Version OS is compatible with the latest app update 10.73.xx. Tech support is a joke. they still think that app release version number is what your phone OS version needs to be to be compatible. I cant recomend the USAA Mobile App for use.. and there are thsounds of long time USAA Patriots that have been pushed out of the app like I have.,2025-04-13,3

This app is breaking my confidence in USAA. 99% of the time when I try to pay my credit card I have to do it twice because of some weird error. The amount of times the app is down or I don't have access to my bank account is becoming too often. I wanted to pay my credit card to buy groceries but I could not do that.

The longer you stay with them as a loyal customer you are likely being overcharged as they will increase their rates by $20-$30 each policy renewal, which adds up long term.",2025-02-09,3

Why do I now have to allow access to my location to make a transfer. This permission was & should not be required. The UI falls behind other companies that provide mobile banking apps as well.

I uninstalled USAA and now it won't let me sign in on Wi-Fi, gives the unavailable error everyone is mentioning. Then when I do get signed in, if won't let me change the login type to use biometrics. Never had this issue when I got a new phone some time in the Summer of 2021. Clearly, the updates have not been good ones since then.",2025-02-15,4

Update: app working now. Adding 3 stars. Use it a lot. I'm trying to deposit checks into my accounts. Using a pc's not allowed anymore so I had to use the mobile app. The app worked one time but now will not open. Message says my device operating system is no longer supported.

I'm trying to deposit checks into my accounts.,2025-02-08,4

Why do I now have to allow access to my location to make a transfer. This permission was & should not be required. The UI falls behind other companies that provide mobile banking apps as well. Most others have had instant purchase notifications. Setting up notifications in the USAA app simply clutter your app inbox and notifications tend to come in hours later. Who ever is behind the UIUX team consistently makes poor choices that lead to a worse experience after every freaking update.,2025-04-06,5

I uninstalled USAA and now it won't let me sign in on Wi-Fi, gives the unavailable error everyone is mentioning. Then when I do get signed in, if won't let me change the login type to use biometrics. Never had this issue when I got a new phone some time in the Summer of 2021. Clearly, the updates have not been good ones since then.",2025-02-15,5

Update: app working now. Adding 3 stars. Use it a lot. I'm trying to deposit checks into my accounts. Using a pc's not allowed anymore so I had to use the mobile app. The app worked one time but now will not open. Message says my device operating system is no longer supported.

I'm trying to deposit checks into my accounts.,2025-02-08,5

"USAA has always provided a wonderful customer experience for me for these 40+ years. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because of the USAA PERKS system, and those companies like Arriva who aren't a good representation of the USAA customer.

When using PERKS, be mindful of the disclaimer that the source is a third party.Don't expect the same type of customer experience.",2024-09-14,5
