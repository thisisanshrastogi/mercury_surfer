I find Credit One's payment processing to be unsatisfactory; a ten-day delay in reflecting payments is unacceptable. And every month they send a different agreement if you don't follow up on the agreement they will keep doing whatever they want. They also charge $4 interest fees on cash withdraws that I NEVER charged every month plus $95 for the yearly fee,2025-05-23,1
this bank is horrible I never made a account they took money out my business bank account sent a card with my name some where else the only way I knew was threw my bank statement this card been made call credit filed dispute and 30 to 60 days is what the tell me then after the 60 day when I ask whats the instructions now this rep tell me I can't tell you what to do now it never happened before.. WTH WHERE MY MONEY???,2025-05-23,1
"banks are awful, the security only ever locks me out. it takes forever and updates too much. i hate using apps and banks and they're all terrible and a huge hassle to deal with. I don't want to verify 5 times, put in passwords over and over, open tab after tab to put in a code to get a secret link to change a pin number. it's awful and complicated and I hate it.",2025-05-23,1
my card was charged in another state. I provided them with evidence that I was at work when the charge was made. The charge was made in-store. They told me I had to call the store and take the matter up with them myself,2025-05-23,1
I'm having trouble when it comes to my username and my password trying to login and it will not take my password I've done everything I was told to do on the phone yesterday I was told I had to go online to change my last name and I'm not getting nowhere,2025-05-23,1
app is not user friendly if you have different accounts with credit one you can't add additional account to your profile,2025-05-23,1
If I could give negative stars I would. DO NOT GET THIS CARD. They have ridiculous interest charges always added on the 15th. They make your card over limit when its not then you have to wait 48 hours for them to correct it. I pay my bill on time and they still charged a late fee. Had to wait 48 hours to correct it. They are rude and nobody speaks proper ENGLISH. AVOID THIS CARD,2025-05-23,1
"Got this card several years ago and honestly didn't use it often because I have other rewards cards I use way more often because of the obvious reason that I get money for using them. Well, out of nowhere, and with no warning, Credit One just closed my account! I mean a letter, an email, a phone call, something to tell me they were doing this would've been nice before they did it! So annoyed with them because a closed account like that never looks good on your credit. Do not recommend!",2025-05-22,1
"scam absolute ripoff! dont fall for ""their use express payment for $7.95 so you dont get charged a late fee"" i used express payment paid the $7.95 before 5pm only to be charged a late fee! beware stay away there are better options available!",2025-05-22,1
"STAY AWAY FROM THIS CARD AND THIS APP. HAD MY ACCOUNT UNDER CREDIT PROTECTION BENEFIT AND THEY CLOSED TJE ACCOUNT WHICH IMMEDIATELY CRASHED MY CREDIT SCORE.

worst ever. I applied for another credit card I hate it so much.,2025-05-22,1
The only thing you can do in this app is check your balance.,2025-05-22,1
The worse Credit Card to get. I can't reach a customer service rep at all. I called the number it says enter your last 4 digits of your credit card and social to get through. And it says card not found? ü§î but they still carge me monthly. And they are charging me the 1 time yearly fee every month. And also charging me credit protect in which I never asked for. I pay my monthly on time. but with the fraudulent fees it's like if I am only paying $10!? üò≤ I just can't get through to an operator!,2025-05-22,1

Random interest charges and takes a long time for your payment to be reflected in your account.,2025-05-19,1
I hate the scheme of having you pay 9 dollars to pay your bill today for some bs live agent to ask for your sn or utilize a standard payment option that can take 3 to 5 days to process. and another week to be made available. Archaic scheme to take advantage of people trying to raise their credit,2025-05-19,1

"I have canceled autopay repeatedly, but Credit One keeps charging my bank account and then adds a return payment fee when it doesn't go through. You will also be charged again if that puts you over your limit. Customer service conversations are always hard to interpret due to heavy accents.

"Horrible bank to work with. Gave them a shot because they offered an AmEx credit card. have had them about a year, went through a rough patch, and had 1 returned/missed payment. no longer allowed to set up auto-pay, so I have to remember to go in every month and make a payment, the whole purpose of having auto pay. Also, the minute you're past due, less than 24 hours, they make sure to start blowing your phone up saying you have a past due balance. Worst customer service of any card I have",2025-05-16,1

very sad credit card company making a standard payment takes 2 or 3 days for them to actually take the money from your credit card which is bad for people who keep there credit cards locked!!! which means you have to unlock your credit card for a few days so that they can get the money!! which is not good!!!!,2025-05-15,1
This credit card company is the most horrible company to deal with. Once I pay my small balance off I will never do business with them again and I wouldn't recommend them to anyone not even to my worst enemy. I wished that they had zero stars because that's what they deserve but they don't have that option.,2025-05-15,1
if I could I would give it a negative 5 pr even a 10! the most difficult bank that I've ever had to deal with. dont get an account with credit one bank they make the presses very difficult and ask for the most unnecessary things to just get access to your account to to create one. capital one is honestly the best one for start off's,2025-05-14,1

Do not get a credit card with credit one if you get behind on one payment they will call and call for 50.00. they call so much you won't be able to call out on an emergency or use your phone for work.

"Absolutely awful and predatory. It takes 5 days to verify your bank account, otherwise you need to pay $8 for an ""express"" payment with a debit card. This means you need to set up your payment info two weeks before the due date.

ETA: 5/13/25 Still nothing has been done. They refuse to help. Oh and they've already charged my account almost $100 and want a $30 payment even though I've never once gotten to use the card!

I simply cannot stand how it doesn't show the balance before and after the charge. I also cannot stand how even though I made a payment it doesn't acknowledge it as cleared when I try to make a second payment. this app could use some heavily working over to make it more user friendly. of all the credit card apps out there and this one is so basic it doesn't care to show you any balances of what's owed compared to what's pending. please update and fix this.,2025-05-09,1

I owe them money because they called me at least 25 times a day if you're one day late on the payment. Do not use this card. it will keep you strained and stressed.,2025-03-26,1
"your fees are just too high , so I'm not going to use your card anymore, I'm going to keep acct open , so I don't get charged $1,000 (made up) for closing it, then I'll just pay it off as fast as possible, and then I will get rid of it .. your card was a fine Card and thank you for your great service, but their are just too many other cards out there they offer more at less fee percentages . so again thank you for all your help, but I have to join on with a different card.. ‚úåÔ∏è",2025-03-26,1
I've been with them over 2 years and I still can't get my credit limit raised,2025-03-26,1
They keep changing the payment date each month to purposely make you late so they can add more & more fees. Wish I could give them a ZERO!,2025-03-26,1
i have had my card with them for awhile now. but all of a sudden I have to verify my identity with them to unlock my card. but yet being a renter I don't have my name on the documents they ask for and its just a mess. plus good luck getting a customer service rep that you can understand even a little bit. Will be closing my account with them shortly. Definitely not worth the hassle of going thru the 3 ring circus with this company,2025-03-25,1
worst credit card,2025-03-25,1
won't even let me make an account.,2025-03-24,1
credit one closed my account and I had a perfect payment record! they lost my business....how stupid,2025-03-24,1
"would rate this a 0 star if I could. this place is a total joke if you bank with chime and then pay off a total balance that you owe, they'll freeze your account and then will say that it was ""suspicious"" and then even after sending Proof documents that you sent the payment From Your Own Bank, they STILL will deny it and keep your card frozen. I strongly reccoment staying away from Credit ""N""One.",2025-03-24,1
they call WAY too many times. they will harrass you when one payment is nearing it's due date. I get about 7-10 calls every day it's becoming an issue. I'm about to close this credit service simply because I can't stand them blowing up my phone,2025-03-24,1
"I am disgusted and disappointed with this company. I have had nothing, but issues with my card since I received it. I confirmed my transaction was valid via text, with 2 customer service representatives, the fraud department. And a supervisor. Each told me that the issue was resolved and to try my transaction again, just to have the same issue. The last representative told me everything was in order then she tells me to use another payment method. $84 in fees for nothing",2025-03-24,1
This app is almost as bad as Credit One Bank. You have to text or email verify every single time you login whether or not you remember your password. Not to mention the minor glitches and bugs. This app sucks,2025-03-24,1
not good,2025-03-24,1
"Worst to deal with. I always paid early. Recently, I had events that caused hardship. They refused to work out any type of plan. They call relentlessly even with a scheduled payment. Very nasty people to try to speak with.",2025-03-23,1
sucks!,2025-03-23,1
this a predatory credit card company that over charges even the scummiest of loan sharks.,2025-03-22,1
I find Credit One's payment processing to be unsatisfactory; a ten-day delay in reflecting payments is unacceptable. And every month they send a different agreement if you don't follow up on the agreement they will keep doing whatever they want. They also charge $4 interest fees on cash withdraws that I NEVER charged every month plus $95 for the yearly fee,2025-05-23,2
this bank is horrible I never made a account they took money out my business bank account sent a card with my name some where else the only way I knew was threw my bank statement this card been made call credit filed dispute and 30 to 60 days is what the tell me then after the 60 day when I ask whats the instructions now this rep tell me I can't tell you what to do now it never happened before.. WTH WHERE MY MONEY???,2025-05-23,2
"banks are awful, the security only ever locks me out. it takes forever and updates too much. i hate using apps and banks and they're all terrible and a huge hassle to deal with. I don't want to verify 5 times, put in passwords over and over, open tab after tab to put in a code to get a secret link to change a pin number. it's awful and complicated and I hate it.",2025-05-23,2
my card was charged in another state. I provided them with evidence that I was at work when the charge was made. The charge was made in-store. They told me I had to call the store and take the matter up with them myself,2025-05-23,2
I'm having trouble when it comes to my username and my password trying to login and it will not take my password I've done everything I was told to do on the phone yesterday I was told I had to go online to change my last name and I'm not getting nowhere,2025-05-23,2
app is not user friendly if you have different accounts with credit one you can't add additional account to your profile,2025-05-23,2
If I could give negative stars I would. DO NOT GET THIS CARD. They have ridiculous interest charges always added on the 15th. They make your card over limit when its not then you have to wait 48 hours for them to correct it. I pay my bill on time and they still charged a late fee. Had to wait 48 hours to correct it. They are rude and nobody speaks proper ENGLISH. AVOID THIS CARD,2025-05-23,2
"Got this card several years ago and honestly didn't use it often because I have other rewards cards I use way more often because of the obvious reason that I get money for using them. Well, out of nowhere, and with no warning, Credit One just closed my account! I mean a letter, an email, a phone call, something to tell me they were doing this would've been nice before they did it! So annoyed with them because a closed account like that never looks good on your credit. Do not recommend!",2025-05-22,2
"scam absolute ripoff! dont fall for ""their use express payment for $7.95 so you dont get charged a late fee"" i used express payment paid the $7.95 before 5pm only to be charged a late fee! beware stay away there are better options available!",2025-05-22,2

The only thing you can do in this app is check your balance.,2025-05-22,2
The worse Credit Card to get. I can't reach a customer service rep at all. I called the number it says enter your last 4 digits of your credit card and social to get through. And it says card not found? ü§î but they still carge me monthly. And they are charging me the 1 time yearly fee every month. And also charging me credit protect in which I never asked for.

very sad credit card company making a standard payment takes 2 or 3 days for them to actually take the money from your credit card which is bad for people who keep there credit cards locked!!! which means you have to unlock your credit card for a few days so that they can get the money!! which is not good!!!!,2025-05-15,2

"800 credit limit: I haven't used my credit card for the first couple of years that I had it. I started using it more often last year. Before I started using it, I would get charges that I wasn't aware of due to the setting, such as authorize user fees of 19.xx. I thought I had the $0 annual fee and then found out i have one. They usually waived it or refunded it. Now that I started using it with small purchases, I've been getting charged $5 monthly annual fee and no way to waive it.",2025-03-29,2
Your always charging late fees when I pay on the day it's do and I'm about to pay it off and cancel it,2025-03-29,2
FEES FEES FEES! If this is the only card you can get it's ok. Otherwise who tf charges for a credit card?! 20 to open and 10 a year to keep it open. Yall can get lost,2025-03-28,2
Constantly break federal laws,2025-03-28,2

two step verification is annoying,2025-03-28,2
confused,2025-03-28,2
Your new mobile app is not backwards compatible. I'm not going to upgrade my phone just so I can use your app. The old app worked fine on my Note 8 Android which still works great too.,2025-03-27,2
"I ordered a color upgrade to my card (black). A month went by and still nothing. After HOURS, I finally got a REAL FRICKEN person on the phone who barely spoke English. They told me that the upgrade request didn't go through and to do it again. SURPRISE, SURPRISE, I could not request the upgrade because I ALREADY REQUESTED ONE. Trash. Absolute trash.",2025-03-27,2
it's a stupid app,2025-03-26,2
too much interest,2025-03-26,2
very bad luck,2025-03-26,2
I owe them money because they called me at least 25 times a day if you're one day late on the payment. Do not use this card. it will keep you strained and stressed.,2025-03-26,2
"your fees are just too high , so I'm not going to use your card anymore, I'm going to keep acct open , so I don't get charged $1,000 (made up) for closing it, then I'll just pay it off as fast as possible, and then I will get rid of it .. your card was a fine Card and thank you for your great service, but their are just too many other cards out there they offer more at less fee percentages . so again thank you for all your help, but I have to join on with a different card.. ‚úåÔ∏è",2025-03-26,2
I've been with them over 2 years and I still can't get my credit limit raised,2025-03-26,2
They keep changing the payment date each month to purposely make you late so they can add more & more fees. Wish I could give them a ZERO!,2025-03-26,2
i have had my card with them for awhile now. but all of a sudden I have to verify my identity with them to unlock my card. but yet being a renter I don't have my name on the documents they ask for and its just a mess. plus good luck getting a customer service rep that you can understand even a little bit. Will be closing my account with them shortly. Definitely not worth the hassle of going thru the 3 ring circus with this company,2025-03-25,2
worst credit card,2025-03-25,2
won't even let me make an account.,2025-03-24,2
credit one closed my account and I had a perfect payment record! they lost my business....how stupid,2025-03-24,2
"would rate this a 0 star if I could. this place is a total joke if you bank with chime and then pay off a total balance that you owe, they'll freeze your account and then will say that it was ""suspicious"" and then even after sending Proof documents that you sent the payment From Your Own Bank, they STILL will deny it and keep your card frozen. I strongly reccoment staying away from Credit ""N""One.",2025-03-24,2
they call WAY too many times. they will harrass you when one payment is nearing it's due date. I get about 7-10 calls every day it's becoming an issue. I'm about to close this credit service simply because I can't stand them blowing up my phone,2025-03-24,2
"I am disgusted and disappointed with this company. I have had nothing, but issues with my card since I received it. I confirmed my transaction was valid via text, with 2 customer service representatives, the fraud department. And a supervisor. Each told me that the issue was resolved and to try my transaction again, just to have the same issue. The last representative told me everything was in order then she tells me to use another payment method. $84 in fees for nothing",2025-03-24,2
This app is almost as bad as Credit One Bank. You have to text or email verify every single time you login whether or not you remember your password. Not to mention the minor glitches and bugs. This app sucks,2025-03-24,2
not good,2025-03-24,2
"Worst to deal with. I always paid early. Recently, I had events that caused hardship. They refused to work out any type of plan. They call relentlessly even with a scheduled payment. Very nasty people to try to speak with.",2025-03-23,2

"I figured I could give negative stars I would. I was promised that if I stayed with the company, they would waive the fees for a period, and I could call back for them to do it again. they refused, the manager lady actually yelled at me and this is all over a stupid $25. it's ridiculous. Just use capital one. they suck, but not NEARLY as bad as craditone.",2025-03-21,2
after getting the bill paid the first time they then want to ask me for my ID a utility bill and my w-2s. this place is a sham it's a fraud I would not go with them I would never even trust them with any of your information run for the hills if you're thinking of coming here,2025-03-21,2

"Not recommended at all. They are not transparent about their policies. I had no idea they had an annual fee when I signed up for the credit card. Hardly any benefits, minimal cashback, not worth $95 a year. Save your money, don't get fooled.",2025-03-19,2
The only time the app works is when you pay your bill. Everything else is awful,2025-03-18,2
"Customer service is a joke. They suspended my account for ""fraudulent application"" 4 days after opeing then after 3 weeks of emailing documents back and forth they finally tell me it's because my address on my ID doesn't match, even tho I provided 5 additional supporting documents AND the address is literally the apartment building next door, in the same complex. So i would have to wait 30 days+ to get that, to access my account. The unnecessary back and forth convinced me to just close the card",2025-03-18,2

They say it takes 3 to 5 business days to updat ur balance i made my payment on time and now i am not allowed to use my card or nothing till the 25th of this month.

One day late $35,2025-05-16,2
"Charge an extra $7.95 for instant and it still gets put into pending for like 7 days, so still a chance to accidentally go negative on your checking account. that's bogus.

Bank is terrible. I unfortunately have two credit cards with this bank. and I feel like there's constant fees sometimes for no reason. My other Credit card lines don't have these fees and i wish i knew it before i signed up for them. I'm trying to pay it off just so I can close it completely because I do not want this bank anymore and the app is glitchy and sometimes it's completely under maintenance and I can't put a payment out there and then I get charged a late fee.,2025-05-04,2

Greedy bank like all of them with a 5pm cutoff for payment. doesn't give you time to even get home from work. I got these cards when I was struggling financially. once I pay them off I will be closing these accounts since they don't appreciate their customers.,2025-04-18,2

"Extremely inconvenient, card is constantly being declined/locked due to hard to understand reasoning. It got declined/ blocked with no late payments and with plenty of credit available because they deemed a charhe at CVS ""suspicious"".

The card is almost worth not having because of the ridiculous amount of time it takes to figure out how to get a picture of confirmation number. Makes no sense,2025-01-26,2
"I feel that the fees to add money are too high. In the long run, I end up spending more on fees than what I deposit. With this app, you should allow same day deposit without the extra fees to do so as a thank you to long-term loyal customers. Show your customer some love back.",2025-01-24,2

"I like to make my payment the day it's due. Why is the payment ""held"" for a few days unless I pay $7.95? Transactions are done at the speed of light. Why are payments held in ""limbo "" for days?

Never dispute anything because it's only a waste of time they don't side with you on any dispute. Very rude customer service as well like to hang up on people and aren't patient.

I simply cannot stand how it doesn't show the balance before and after the charge. I also cannot stand how even though I made a payment it doesn't acknowledge it as cleared when I try to make a second payment. this app could use some heavily working over to make it more user friendly. of all the credit card apps out there and this one is so basic it doesn't care to show you any balances of what's owed compared to what's pending. please update and fix this.,2025-05-09,3

it seems to be hard to get into the system,2025-04-10,3
"DO NOT get this card. they hit you with a $75 fee upon first using the card, then when you try to make a payment they take 7 business days to process the payment, then hit you with a late fee, even if you pay early.

"I've had so many issues with credit one, and any time I've asked to speak to a supervisor, they have never been able to connect me with one. they either put me on hold indefinitely (literally hours until they disconnect the call), or you they say they will have a supervisor return my call in ""30 minutes"" but I never receive a call. unless of course it's within the week of my account statement being due, then they harass me able paying them.",2025-04-08,3
Worse app ever. Under maintenance 5 hours a day. also charge you interest on a zero balance credit card. they add the 10 monthly fee then charge you 30 % interest on that fee. completely illegal I will be taking legal action. as there already a billion dollar lawsuit against for adding interest and fees to people credit card that shouldn't be,2025-04-08,3

the express payment is not clear about if your balance is past due that you are still stuck waiting 5-7 business days for the payment to reflect on the card. most annoying üòë üôÑ and frustrated üò† üò° with lack of transparency. if I could opt for zero stars üåü that would be my rating for them.,2025-04-07,3
it locks you out for some dumb reason then you can't even check it you have to call and check really makes no sense to use this app poor app stop blocking people out,2025-04-07,3

App is easy to use. Thank God cause it is the only recourse you have. If you can't do it on the app you are in trouble because there is absolutely NO CUSTOMER SERVICE OR WAY TO GET A HUMAN ON THE PHONE. Their automated line is useless. They refuse to help or refund your fraudulent charges (Lost $1000) and tell you to message them on Facebook! REALLY!? What legit company does business by Facebook Messenger?? I've paid off these cards and locked them. Don't use them!,2025-04-06,3

bad experience is not good,2025-04-05,3
"Limited and basic, this app is the only one I [am forced to] use that has never once been able to remember my device. It has me name my device and sends me an email to confirm registration every single time, too, just to remind me how miserable it is to check my balance. The payment process is painful and has messed me up before being so complicated and wonky. Terrible card that I will keep paying off and not using, keeping purely for the account age and history on my credit reporting...",2025-04-05,3
tryed numerous times to set up app failed every time no customer service go somewhere else,2025-04-05,3
"App works great! The service is no good. Not only is there an annual fee to hold this card, APR is ridiculously high and it takes them forever to update Available Credit even after they take your money. My advice is to skip this card, or get it and just leave it in the drawer. (btw, this is the case for most low score credit cards. I'm running into the same issue with OneMain Financial)",2025-04-05,3
crazy company... they approved me for 300$ then locked the card cuz my address supposedly didn't match. then a alien from outside our country told me I had to prove who I am and where I live and wanted a copy of my bank statement and a bill... like NO reason someone from another country should be asking me to identify myself... these creditors should really use American people in there offices and should really be better at there jobs... failed company.,2025-04-04,3
It's Awful !,2025-04-04,3

Consumer beware. The Better Business Bureau has well articulated cases of shady at best business practices advising consumers to air on the side of caution when giving your money & access to your sensitive information to a company who is a copy and paste version of the company it coined an almost exact name for itself. other words credit now should be in your wallet. Also ya you might get the fake bank before your credit score earned you'll only lose on the higher apr's FEES due diligence do it,2025-04-02,3

"800 credit limit: I haven't used my credit card for the first couple of years that I had it. I started using it more often last year. Before I started using it, I would get charges that I wasn't aware of due to the setting, such as authorize user fees of 19.xx. I thought I had the $0 annual fee and then found out i have one. They usually waived it or refunded it. Now that I started using it with small purchases, I've been getting charged $5 monthly annual fee and no way to waive it.",2025-03-29,3

i have had my card with them for awhile now. but all of a sudden I have to verify my identity with them to unlock my card. but yet being a renter I don't have my name on the documents they ask for and its just a mess. plus good luck getting a customer service rep that you can understand even a little bit. Will be closing my account with them shortly. Definitely not worth the hassle of going thru the 3 ring circus with this company,2025-03-25,3

I strongly reccoment staying away from Credit ""N""One.",2025-03-24,3
they call WAY too many times. they will harrass you when one payment is nearing it's due date. I get about 7-10 calls every day it's becoming an issue. I'm about to close this credit service simply because I can't stand them blowing up my phone,2025-03-24,3
"I am disgusted and disappointed with this company. I have had nothing, but issues with my card since I received it. I confirmed my transaction was valid via text, with 2 customer service representatives, the fraud department. And a supervisor.

The last representative told me everything was in order then she tells me to use another payment method. $84 in fees for nothing",2025-03-24,3
This app is almost as bad as Credit One Bank. You have to text or email verify every single time you login whether or not you remember your password. Not to mention the minor glitches and bugs. This app sucks,2025-03-24,3
not good,2025-03-24,3

I was promised that if I stayed with the company, they would waive the fees for a period, and I could call back for them to do it again. they refused, the manager lady actually yelled at me and this is all over a stupid $25. it's ridiculous.

Can I sign in to my credit one bank mobile app saying error,2025-04-06,3
no screenshots on payment verification is dumb. I'm not writing info on paper so I can have someone take it when I could have it in my phone safely,2025-04-03,3
Cannot take screenshots to have verification of payments made saved to My phone....I HATE that!!!! Also no option for the account to recognize My device so I have to input a code sent through text or e-mail EVERY time I sign in UGH. Otherwise it is a decent application.,2025-04-03,3
i dislike confirming each time,2025-04-02,3
when my credit was great you company waited two months to update but now I dropped 10 points it updated immediately. Sad...,2025-03-30,3

The app is not up to date when payments are made. Also had the card for over 2 years and Credit One bank has never increased my credit line or take off membership fee. I've been trying to restore credit from identity theft,2025-03-15,3
Not to excited about these credit one credit cards. It never lets me make a payment until it's about late or. As a matter of fact I will pay them off and not use them again!!,2025-03-15,3
"Extremely inconvenient, card is constantly being declined/locked due to hard to understand reasoning. It got declined/ blocked with no late payments and with plenty of credit available because they deemed a charhe at CVS ""suspicious"". Also the CS reps have been very rude to me, accuse me of being disingenuous, cut me off while I'm explaining, and then criticize me for not letting them finish talking, which they were unable to properly do since I didn't get to finish my point. Disappointed",2025-03-15,3
Why is the app not allowing me to unlock my card fix it. Keeps saying unavailable for 3 days,2025-03-15,3

Both this app and the website are glitchy...,2025-03-06,3
I regret highly setting this account up. As soon as credit is paid off im closing it. The credit limit is insulting compared to my banks limit ive been given which is 5x as much and the app is annoying to use,2025-03-06,3
It's ok the code is annoying,2025-03-02,3
It would be nice to not have to enter a verification code every single login,2025-02-28,3

If you looking to build your score, this one I definitely wouldn't recommend.",2025-02-27,3

"Though I was grateful to get approved for this card, the fees are ridiculous. I needed to make an express payment. Not only did I get charged 7.95 when I made the payment, they charged me an additional 7.95 to my card. So ended up paying over $55 just to make a payment of $40. I gotta spend money to make a payment. Unreal. Don't be like me. Take your time to read the fine print.",2025-02-17,3
I don't like that you can't pay more than 1 card at a time without exiting out of the app,2025-02-15,3

I don't care for verification process,2025-02-11,3
How long does it take from them to send your card been waiting a week and nothing,2025-02-11,3
"My experience matches many of the irritated people who wrote negative e reviews. They suck you in my promising yiu you are approved for $$$$ amount of credit, which is how a lot of these oddball cards operate for people who have really bad credit due not paying the bill off ever.

Least user friendly app out of all my credit cards,2025-01-29,3
U should be able 2 pay with any type of card on app,2025-01-28,3
Simple but why no screen shots is dumb. The screenshot is for confirmation #. Proof of payment. I don't understand why no screenshot. The card is almost worth not having because of the ridiculous amount of time it takes to figure out how to get a picture of confirmation number. Makes no sense,2025-01-26,3
"I feel that the fees to add money are too high. In the long run, I end up spending more on fees than what I deposit. With this app, you should allow same day deposit without the extra fees to do so as a thank you to long-term loyal customers. Show your customer some love back.",2025-01-24,3

"App is easy to navigate. Customer Service is awful. India needs to step it up. They speak perfectly good English but are not good with comprehending the wants of Customers.

Getting charged twice for the 1 payment I originally wanted. Do better guys n gals",2024-12-31,3
"It's ok for building credit, and that's it. Too many fees, and if you call customer service and have to wait, you'll have to hear, every 10 seconds, ""We appreciate your patience.

I'm convinced it's to have you to hang up. It's horrible!!!!",2024-12-31,3

App works good just be warned to anyone who just got a credit one card....Customer service is trash probably worst I've seen out of a credit card company. Never dispute anything because it's only a waste of time they don't side with you on any dispute. Very rude customer service as well like to hang up on people and aren't patient.

The app hardly let's you make payments. There is always some issue. Until you click the $7.95 additional to use a live representative then it magically works again once they get their 8 bucks smh.,2024-10-17,3
took me four days and over 2 hours on the phone to make a payment. used my debit card for the first payment and now it isn't giving me that option,2024-10-15,3
"I got a new card and made a couple purchases. I thought I would pay the balance early to avoid the monthly finance charge but that wasn't the case. I could make a payment with an $8 fee attached or setup a bank account for free. They were supposed to make a couple small deposits to verify the account but they took nearly 10 days to do it and by then the payment would've been late. I made the express payment and the $8 charge, feel like they scammed me so I'm closing this account.",2024-10-15,3
I have found cash back nonexistent! I am not happy with this card.,2024-10-14,3
"I've used this app for a few years to make payments, as of the past week, the app has been very glitchy. I've been logging in, trying to make a payment and it says no payment due, which isnt true. I load my info to make an express payment and just when I get it all entered, a message pops up saying there is an issue on our end, we're trying to resolve the matter.",2024-10-14,3
Why do I have to sign in twice. It's stupid. We shouldn't have to use a code if we already have our password!!! It's stupid!!!,2024-10-13,3

"This app has gotten to be the most annoying credit card app out there lately not sure why the past few months i must verify my identity through email or text every single time i use the app no other app i have does this so i must wait for text or email everytime and enter codes maybe you should update the app to the technology other companies have like the "" i recognize your device"" constant updates but only gets worse",2024-10-08,3
I wanted to make more than the minimum payment.,2024-10-08,3
"Why are you guys charging me almost $10 just to pay my bill, omg, fee for repaying money-crazy.",2024-10-07,3

"App works great and fairly simple to do your thing. Would be 5 stars if they didn't charge like $6-7 just to ""have the fund available sooner"". Ditgimine sucker fees and I'll edit this.",2024-10-05,3
It takes too long to sign in to the app,2024-10-04,3

Bank is trash app is trash....,2024-10-03,3
"As soon as you owe them a dime, they will repeatedly call you 15 times a day to set up a payment. I only owe $14 on my card and it's due in 10 days and they called me 8 times yesterday. They act like a money hungry drug addict that wants their money.",2024-10-03,3
Why tf do I need a live person to come online to send me to an automated system to charge my payment using a debit card and it cost an extra 8$ üòí I pay my cap one card using the automated system and for free without all the extra steps,2024-10-03,3
This card is too high maintenance. Makes it inconvenient to use at times,2024-10-01,3
"Total scam everything was working at first , everything going smooth for a month made my first payment got the money back so I can spend again, second time I made my monthly payment, which was 3 days ago from today, right after that I try to use my card and it getting denied every where. So I call customer service and they said oh it's a automatic security protocol to lock your card if it's a suspicious purchase I said ok cool unlock my card. It 3 days later and I still can't use my card",2024-09-29,3
Too difficult to make a payment change accounts. Add accounts just too difficult,2024-09-26,3
"I have security on my phone. I need a password to get in app. Why can I not take screenshots after going through this 2 layered security? I use screenshots for receipts. Whoever came up with that stupid idea should be fired immediately. As soon as I pay this off, deleting the card and the app",2024-09-26,3
They charge $8 to pay with a debit card and interest rates are high,2024-09-25,3
"I really disapprove of this app... Most of it is completely useless. It's more irritating than helpful... I should give I 1 star but it tells me my balance... And... Well not much else there isn't any insight or assisting options. Really needs improvement, but what can I expect it's just CreditOne.",2024-09-25,3
I just open this account not even a few weeks ago had no problems with transactions all of sudden after I made my first big payment and have available credit it declines everywhere I go. Customer service was not help they told me they don't hold or freeze accounts and told me to take a break using the card for it to rest and then It will go through. A second person said to turn my notifications then it will go through went to several merchants trying to use the card declined have 280 in credit.,2024-09-23,3
They take too long to take money out of your account and say that your payment is past due when it's being processed,2024-09-23,3
"App always freezes, logging in doesn't work more half the time.",2024-09-23,3
Terrible card and even WORSE customer service. Made a payment out of one bank account it takes it out of another. I go to cancel the payment to make sure it comes out of the right account doesn't allow me to do so. Customer service was super unhelpful and because of this I am going to have a $35 late fee. This is terrible practice. No reason I should not have been able to cancel the payment I had just made it!!,2024-09-21,3
Ok,2024-09-21,3

Different and unclear,2024-09-13,3
"It's just too many darn steps just to log in. I appreciate the extra security but that should be on your end, not mine. For instance, I can log into Navy Fed or Capital One with one step & not have to wait for a text message or an email confirmation number, I can just have instant access to the app. I am very positive that they use some kind of protection so their users can have instant access and not wait for a confirmation number that they have to type in via another app.",2024-09-13,3
90% of the time the app is down. Always something going on and it's aggravating.,2024-09-12,3

I was not able to find a option that would allow me to change my payment methods,2024-09-06,3
Express fee is rediculous and unnecessary. Charged to make a payment!!,2024-09-05,3
App works fine its the outright thievery for using a debit card $7.95 . And also no communication between credit one to me.,2024-09-04,3

"The app is decent, easy navigation and pretty self explanatory. The company itself though, lmao! Card get declined left and right even though my balance is in good standing. Customer service although nice, is no help whatsoever. Would've never signed up with this company if I knew how irritating it is to simply use a card.",2024-08-25,3

"Would be better if you could schedule payments like the major card issuers!!! Don't like that CreditOne doesn't update your balance in a timely manner.

it's great.,2025-04-29,3
Not a fan of being charged to add immediate available credit to my account when most of my other cc's don't do that,2025-04-28,3
"doesn't want to work right to pay or even load sometimes, there's a charge to call but it's not my end with the problem",2025-04-28,3

Terrible. Should be banned.,2025-04-27,3
says I have credit limit for cash. but will not let me withdraw it at ATM. how do you use it?,2025-04-25,3
"[04/24/2025] I'll update this later, but I just got my card in today, and noticed that $95 dollars was missing from my available credit. That sucks but I don't plan in using this as my main credit card anyways. The app loads super slow for me, but I counter this by using the website. I'll come back here and update once I use the card and make a payment. For now, I'll leave 3 stars. It's okay. My Capital One is my main credit card love herüòç",2025-04-24,3

"very difficult to sign in, have to reset password every time and the customer service person i spoke with was rude and arrogant.",2025-04-21,3
they don't ever increase your limit no matter how long you have had the card it doesn't matter if your never late on your payment the credit li.it never increases like it does with other cards,2025-04-21,3
Entering into the app has been difficult.,2025-04-20,3
"you have to pay an$8 fee if after you make a payment, your debt doesn't go down until 7 days have past. it's kind of extortion with my own money",2025-04-19,3

Easy,2025-04-03,3
It's great for a start up credit card. After a while it would be nice if they waive the annual fee. The interest is high and they are already making a kill on that. They should offer a break for the customers.,2025-04-02,3
update: 3/31/2025- My frustration was valid when i made this review. I'm less upset today...(How dare you NOT let me take a screenshot of the confirmation of my current payment. I have Every right to take one for my records and my own piece of mind..HOW DARE YOU!!),2025-04-01,3
-I like this company and the app. If they would allow debit card payments on the app I would be giving this app 5 stars-,2025-03-30,3
it doesn't work for me,2025-03-29,3
"the app seems to work ok, my main complaint is that you have to input your full password to access your accounts. Every other banking/credit card app I've used allows for a pin or fingerprint access and I'm not sure why you can't in this app. I use randomized, unique passwords for all of my accounts, this app is essentially useless because it requires me to input the full password every time I close the app and reopen it.",2025-03-28,3
why can u not take debit and my credit is instant and free on my Mastercard,2025-03-28,3
"I normally don't rate anything. The app works great, but good luck getting an increase. I've paid on time for 8 months. My credit score is 600-700. Save yourself the trouble & go with a different card. It's not a good credit building card.",2025-03-27,3

the interest is somewhat high,2025-03-22,3
"this app only opens half the time, lousy",2025-03-21,3
not as quick entering bank information. Required account number and routing number instead of just using my bank's debit card.,2025-03-21,3
they keep sending me offers for cards with annual fees and probably wondering why I don't accept them. I DO NOT WANT CARDS WITH ANNUAL FEES. I'VE BEEN A CUSTOMER LONG ENOUGH THAT YOU CAN STOP DISRESPECTING ME WITH TRASH CARD OFFERS. my credit history for the last few years is top notch. the cards they offer however are insulting,2025-03-20,3
not working very well glitchy,2025-03-20,3

App is easy enough to use. But waiting for pages to open is like watching grass grow. Annoying,2025-03-15,3
Good,2025-03-14,3
App is generic and banking offers low credit no loan option;there are better credit offers..,2025-03-14,3
Hate credit one the app and everything about. It usually takes 4 or 5 days to take a payment. It's not working half the time.,2025-03-14,3
The rating would be higher if screenshots were allowed in the app.,2025-03-12,3

"I hate having to input my password plus a verification code from text. Also, I don't like how sometimes I can't pay what I know is owed till the end of the month. I understand the process, so not a huge deal just a minor inconvenience.",2025-03-05,3
Your payment process should register so I don't get 10 texts and email from you. Thx,2025-03-02,3
"When logging in the ""one-time login text"" to get into is misleading. You have to receive a text every time in order for the app to recognize that it's you.",2025-02-28,3
Easy to use. Took off TWO üåü üåü because of having to enter a code EVERY.FREAKING.TIME! I don't have to do that work my BANK or my CREDIT UNION,2025-02-28,3
The app is really good for available balance and payment history but in comparison to some apps trying to look up recent transactions it's not as simple,2025-02-25,3
Interest rate too high. I missed on day and I was charged a lot.,2025-02-22,3
Can't log in. DOEST reconise my name or ss number. ü§î,2025-02-22,3

"It's easy to navigate but I would like to see a pay that day option, not a wait 7days for payment to go through",2025-02-18,3
It's ok for now have really used it completely yet,2025-02-17,3
Was excited to get this card. Set up autopay & the 1st payment didn't go through so I was charged a late fee despite having auto pay on. I contacted customer service they were able to reverse $20 of the $29 late fee. Very disappointing to have issues on the 1st month. Hopefully this doesn't happen again. If the developers contact me I won't be able to reply through here & I was told that the late fee is never completely reversed even though they could see I had done everything correctly.,2025-02-17,3
"Hard to navigate, app has limited support and limited features",2025-02-16,3
Always problems with on line system,2025-02-14,3
I do not like every time I log in I have to get a code when I log in from the same device everytime,2025-02-13,3
So far so good I haven't had any issues with the app,2025-02-13,3
have had a great experience using this app,2025-02-10,3
Would be better if you didn't have to pay a fee to pay with your debit card. My other cards I can call the day the bills due or go right on the app and do a debit card payment or right on the phone and do it + the payment goes through right away. You guys charge like a $8 fee? I feel that's kind of ridiculous,2025-02-08,3
Slow,2025-02-07,3
I had some confusion about the primary and secondary bank payments,2025-02-06,3
The apps okay.. the company I do not recommend..,2025-02-05,3
Good but seems to be clunky and very complicated for simple steps. GUI is outdated and needs a refresher,2025-02-05,3

App doesn't download to fast for me !? It's still trying to download and it's been half hour to 45 minutes not !!!,2025-02-02,3
good card,2025-02-01,3
Not interactive enough,2025-01-31,3
The security is to strict for my liking. Hard to do online purchases have to call and verify every time and even then won't go through.,2025-01-28,3
The latency for updates on purchases and available balance is large and isn't helpful. The features are almost useless.,2025-01-28,3
So far all good. Money/credit is secure,2025-01-24,3
Terrible that you charge $9.25 / month as a fee to use card. No perks or points for this. Not a good card to have.,2025-01-24,3
Typical banking type app. Irritating that I have to have to have a code sent every time I sign in.,2025-01-22,3

The text code after logging in with password is rather annoying and time consuming.,2025-01-10,3
soooooooo tired of the extra verification. who's paying my bills???,2025-01-09,3
Hate the fact that you have to have a verification code every single time you go on,2025-01-09,3

when it works it's ok but frequently it doesn't that's why only 3*s,2025-01-03,3
good card but not worth the annual fee unless you have bad credit,2025-01-03,3
This was easier and faster than before. But the fee was increased also so not happy about that,2025-01-02,3
Couldn't make the first payment using my debit card without having to pay an additional fee by having to involve customer service,2025-01-02,3
"Only complaint would be when making a payment, you canNOT just put in a card #, exp., security code. Instead you will need to dig for your routing # and account # to pay. That does NOT work so great when someone gifts you a Christmas present in the form of paying your balance off. They just wanted me to pay it using their card, but couldn't. Instead they had to wait until they got home to get their banking information.",2025-01-01,3
It's decent but standard payment takes way too long to update and while doing so it puts your credit to -1 so i feel that would cause more harm than good in the long run.,2025-01-01,3
"The app is fine it's the bank policies that I don't like. If you make a payment before the due date it should be valid,accepted and your credit should be updated immediately. Verifying my bank account is unnecessary. Everyone knows what account money is in or not. Just be straight up no stupid fees. Thank you not a happy customer credit one.

"Why can't i access Credit One website using Brave or DuckDuckGo? I used Samsung and I get errors. So I had to switch browsers now I get NOT Allowed? This is a way to lose customers. I hate to say it. It doesn't show current transactions, I got a charge, and I have no idea where it came from. I'm forced to wait until the next month statement so I can view it and challenge it.

Not so good,2024-10-03,3
I am still just entering my confirmation no live assistance is done. I resent the $7.95 charge to make my payment.,2024-10-02,3
The only way to pay without using your bank account information is to pay 7.95 and this should not happen there should be a way to not have to pay twice,2024-10-02,3
Okay but unable to change payment method on express pay.,2024-10-01,3

"For some reason this app is ALLWAYS experiencing technical issues and it seems like almost every other time I try to log in I get a message that the site is under construction or something to that effect, if y'all are trying to improve it then stop it's plenty good and if your fixing issues why are there Soo many?",2024-09-30,3

7.99 to pay my bill on the app. Is ridiculous.,2024-09-22,3
"Nice app, very functional. But when making a payment for the last 12 months the agent on the other end puts up my personal information for me to verify and less than a second later puts a very condescending message telling me to accept the info before I can even read it. Yes I have changed my address so I expect one of these times the payment to not go through. Next time I will most likely sit for a minute or two saying , man you are impatient aren't you?",2024-09-22,3
Good card for building credit. Don't like the fee to pay from debit card instead of bank account. It started at $4.95 then jumped up to $7.95! It's hard to pay with bank account when you're already living check to check since there's no guarantee when the payment will actually be taken.,2024-09-21,3

Every time I try to verify my bank account it will not verify I never get the deposit they say they sent for verification so Every time I make my payment I have no choice but to pay the 7.95 fee just to pay with my debit card so will I pay this card off and close the account YES I WILL this is very upsetting how everyone wants to take your money as if things aren't tough enough already.,2024-09-12,3

"The system is set up to force you to add payment methods instead of offering one-time payment methods, and then you still have to store card info in order to move forward and process any payments.

The 7 $ fee is crazy,2024-06-28,3
Would be a good app if you can actually understand how much credit you actually have.,2024-06-26,3

"This credit card is not good. They will insert an annual fee after introductory. Without telling you about it, they will also charge you a service fee for maintaining this credit card with a very high interest rate.

It's a good app my only problem is that I wasn't able to input my new debit card info to make a payment. So I ended calling customer service,2024-06-20,3
I find Credit One's payment processing to be unsatisfactory; a ten-day delay in reflecting payments is unacceptable. And every month they send a different agreement if you don't follow up on the agreement they will keep doing whatever they want. They also charge $4 interest fees on cash withdraws that I NEVER charged every month plus $95 for the yearly fee,2025-05-23,4

app is not user friendly if you have different accounts with credit one you can't add additional account to your profile,2025-05-23,4
If I could give negative stars I would. DO NOT GET THIS CARD. They have ridiculous interest charges always added on the 15th. They make your card over limit when its not then you have to wait 48 hours for them to correct it. I pay my bill on time and they still charged a late fee. Had to wait 48 hours to correct it.

The only thing you can do in this app is check your balance.,2025-05-22,4
The worse Credit Card to get. I can't reach a customer service rep at all. I called the number it says enter your last 4 digits of your credit card and social to get through. And it says card not found? ü§î but they still carge me monthly. And they are charging me the 1 time yearly fee every month. And also charging me credit protect in which I never asked for.

My other Credit card lines don't have these fees and i wish i knew it before i signed up for them.

"Extremely inconvenient, card is constantly being declined/locked due to hard to understand reasoning. It got declined/ blocked with no late payments and with plenty of credit available because they deemed a charhe at CVS ""suspicious"".

App works good just be warned to anyone who just got a credit one card....Customer service is trash probably worst I've seen out of a credit card company. Never dispute anything because it's only a waste of time they don't side with you on any dispute. Very rude customer service as well like to hang up on people and aren't patient. I would only recommend doing tiny purchases on credit one if you must have to or hope to god you don't have to call for any type of customer service issue.,2024-12-06,4

The app frequently does not accept my password and locks my account.,2024-07-25,4
More options..easier to use..,2024-07-24,4
"It's been not a problem. I make my payments on time, and I've been cautious about my spending",2024-07-22,4
"I just feel like it could be more user friendly, but it definitely takes safety precautions",2024-07-18,4
Slow loading,2024-07-18,4
"You don't have the option to lock your card when not in use that's a feature that is ""definitely"" needed to prevent fraud. Unfortunately I have been a victim of thatü§•",2024-07-18,4
Never let's me pay on both accounts unless I back all the way out,2024-07-17,4
Lots of junk mail about being approved for a new card. I tried to turn it off multiple times through settings. It shows that New Account Offers is disabled but I get regular emails telling me that I have been approved for an additional card. Attempts to make contact with a human are thwarted by the auto attendant.,2024-07-17,4
"When trying to add a new bank account, the link timed out 2X with a ""technical error"". Since I can't wait 5 business days for them to manually verify my account, I had to use my debit card (that is attached to the account they can't verify) amd pay an extra $7.95 to pay my bill.",2024-07-16,4
"It's too basic, The simplicity is nice but there are not enough options for things you need to do without having to contact customer support or the bank or app so often. All options for renewing, canceling, troubleshooting, payment, butshould be available in the app, everything, you should never have to do anything regarding this card outside of the app.",2024-07-16,4
Getting approved for $300 with an annual fee is a little acceptable for building credit but making payments are a hassle and cost $7.95 each time,2024-07-16,4
This app is pretty decent what time is the app takes forever to log in and it continues to buffer care for how long it takes for the payments to post,2024-07-15,4
"The system is set up to force you to add payment methods instead of offering one-time payment methods, and then you still have to store card info in order to move forward and process any payments. Other companies, not even financial companies, offer use of ONE - TIME payment options. I am paying up my limit, and will not recommend it to anyone. Actually I have been reading on consumer affairs and other CNN ,business reports of the bad reputation this company and the class action law suit.",2024-07-14,4
"Helpful app, easy to use, however, now this app doesn't want to open and all it does is buffer. I've tried everything to get it to work and nothing helps, so now I use the web!",2024-07-14,4
I don't like. They keep charging anual fee on a monthly basis,2024-07-13,4
hate login,2024-07-12,4
Okay üëå,2024-07-08,4
Fees applied to payments you make. ü§î Not recognized by plaid. Credit score not updated accurately.,2024-07-07,4
It wouldn't log me in to make a payment,2024-07-05,4
The fee is way too high. It should be no more than $3:50 or $4,2024-07-05,4
"Everything okay.But please decide the problem with display money in account after purchase,some autopays.It DOESN'T updating even a few days after!!!! A lot of time to wait to see updating in account.It is lacküëé",2024-07-05,4

"The app and even the website take forever to load. At times, the website will not load and you have to restart.",2024-07-03,4
Standard payments can sometimes take a long time to go though,2024-07-03,4
"This app is, at times, a bit wonky, taking you back to refill in all information. A start over even if ypu haven't made an error. If not for the wobbly bits this app would be great.",2024-06-30,4
Been trying to log into this app with my fingerprint for 3 days and it just keeps spinning. SMH,2024-06-29,4
"I always use express payments to pay my card balance. So I, have access should I need the money immediately. I go to express pay my bill and the fee has gone from $4 to $7.95! That is totally unacceptable. Then the app is absolutely worthless except for 2 things. Paying your bill or reporting your card lost or stolen. No options for credit increase reviews, connecting to customer service thru APP NOPE! You can add a user BUT YOU CAN'T REMOVE THEM THRU THE APP EITHER! SHEISTY FOR SURE. Canceling.",2024-06-28,4
The 7 $ fee is crazy,2024-06-28,4
Would be a good app if you can actually understand how much credit you actually have.,2024-06-26,4
I took 2 stars away. 1 for the $2 increase in express payments. And 1 for how long it takes to increase credit lines. My other credit cards increase the credit like 2 as many times and receive the same credit scores.,2024-06-26,4
"I don't have any issues with the card, I just wish after each charge that it would show available balance even from posted transactions and not only in current time so the charges can be added up",2024-06-25,4
Great,2024-06-24,4
"This credit card is not good. They will insert an annual fee after introductory. Without telling you about it, they will also charge you a service fee for maintaining this credit card with a very high interest rate. On top of that, their app refuses to provide you important information for your account when you need it. Not when you want it when you need it. Big difference overall. I think this card should be burned immediately once its efficacy has served for you if you so choose to get one.",2024-06-23,4
"They are slow, and have to figure out why my accounts will not load",2024-06-22,4

"The touch screen areas are hard to access, but other than that it's a user friendly app.",2024-06-21,4
It's a good app my only problem is that I wasn't able to input my new debit card info to make a payment. So I ended calling customer service,2024-06-20,4
Great organizational features. Pop ups need improvement.,2025-05-24,4
good bank. I have had no issues with any part of my financial journey thanks to the help of credit one bank. they really helped me by giving me a big credit line so I could increase my credit score through responsible and on-time payments.,2025-05-23,4
Increasing my line of credit WITHOUT my consent. I took the setting PUSH off and changed it to TEXT to let me decide if I wanted an increase or not. I will be calling Credit One Bank to speak with them about the credit limit increase that was done without my approval.,2025-05-20,4
"Great card, other than the usage fees.",2025-05-20,4
you fee us to death for everything,2025-05-20,4
my card was supposed to be here Thursday 5/15/2025. it is now Monday 5/19/2025 and have yet to receive my card. I'm literally in desperate need due to spouses illness right now. and that's why I applied. you could at least let me make Digital card to use while frantically waiting on the physical card.,2025-05-19,4

"My Credit One account is okay but sometimes you can't always depend on your transactions going through, you have to keep calling them.",2025-05-15,4
it's a good app but this bank charges alot and quick to put a late mark on your credit report even if you pay it on the day it's due but it's after 5pm so they charge you$30 last fee,2025-05-15,4
"Not bad so far, just started",2025-05-14,4
it's okay,2025-05-14,4
"Everything was ok until I request my middle initial to be added. I had to submit a legal document, no problem. After submitting document, it was approved, but I was never informed about an additional charge that was added to my account after receiving a letter advising me it was approved and there I was hit with the additional charge. I really don't think this was good business. We should be told when we put in the request. Yours truly,",2025-05-14,4

"Great card for people to get their credit back online...... completely disagree with having to PAY like. 20% fee just to get a credit increase. You can never look at this as a long time credit card BECAUSE of just that reason. Annual fees, credit increase fees.... maintenance fees.....LOTS and LOTS of fees for them to extend credit to you.....but ....in th long run....I wouldn't be where I am credit wise if it wasn't for them......but eventually I'll have to part with them because of the fees",2025-04-16,4

The app works fine for knowing my balance and available credit. I haven't used the other features much but they seem convenient. I did look for end of year spending by category but it's not available; for example to see how much I spent on gas or food for the past year.

I find Credit One's payment processing to be unsatisfactory; a ten-day delay in reflecting payments is unacceptable. And every month they send a different agreement if you don't follow up on the agreement they will keep doing whatever they want. They also charge $4 interest fees on cash withdraws that I NEVER charged every month plus $95 for the yearly fee,2025-05-23,5
this bank is horrible I never made a account they took money out my business bank account sent a card with my name some where else the only way I knew was threw my bank statement this card been made call credit filed dispute and 30 to 60 days is what the tell me then after the 60 day when I ask whats the instructions now this rep tell me I can't tell you what to do now it never happened before..

app is not user friendly if you have different accounts with credit one you can't add additional account to your profile,2025-05-23,5
If I could give negative stars I would. DO NOT GET THIS CARD. They have ridiculous interest charges always added on the 15th. They make your card over limit when its not then you have to wait 48 hours for them to correct it. I pay my bill on time and they still charged a late fee. Had to wait 48 hours to correct it. They are rude and nobody speaks proper ENGLISH. AVOID THIS CARD,2025-05-23,5

terrible card,2025-05-15,5
very sad credit card company making a standard payment takes 2 or 3 days for them to actually take the money from your credit card which is bad for people who keep there credit cards locked!!! which means you have to unlock your credit card for a few days so that they can get the money!! which is not good!!!!,2025-05-15,5
This credit card company is the most horrible company to deal with. Once I pay my small balance off I will never do business with them again and I wouldn't recommend them to anyone not even to my worst enemy. I wished that they had zero stars because that's what they deserve but they don't have that option.,2025-05-15,5
if I could I would give it a negative 5 pr even a 10! the most difficult bank that I've ever had to deal with. dont get an account with credit one bank they make the presses very difficult and ask for the most unnecessary things to just get access to your account to to create one. capital one is honestly the best one for start off's,2025-05-14,5
was a joke,2025-05-14,5
big delay in getting payments credited.,2025-05-14,5
Do not get a credit card with credit one if you get behind on one payment they will call and call for 50.00. they call so much you won't be able to call out on an emergency or use your phone for work. They call at least 20 times a day. If I could post a pic. I would to show how much they call.,2025-05-14,5
"Absolutely awful and predatory. It takes 5 days to verify your bank account, otherwise you need to pay $8 for an ""express"" payment with a debit card. This means you need to set up your payment info two weeks before the due date. Your balance only reflects posted transactions, so it's always several days behind, to trick you into spending more money. I've had dozens of CCS and this is the worst.",2025-05-14,5

ETA: 5/13/25 Still nothing has been done. They refuse to help. Oh and they've already charged my account almost $100 and want a $30 payment even though I've never once gotten to use the card!

I simply cannot stand how it doesn't show the balance before and after the charge. I also cannot stand how even though I made a payment it doesn't acknowledge it as cleared when I try to make a second payment. this app could use some heavily working over to make it more user friendly. of all the credit card apps out there and this one is so basic it doesn't care to show you any balances of what's owed compared to what's pending. please update and fix this.,2025-05-09,5

App is easy to use. Thank God cause it is the only recourse you have. If you can't do it on the app you are in trouble because there is absolutely NO CUSTOMER SERVICE OR WAY TO GET A HUMAN ON THE PHONE. Their automated line is useless.

I'm running into the same issue with OneMain Financial)",2025-04-05,5
crazy company... they approved me for 300$ then locked the card cuz my address supposedly didn't match. then a alien from outside our country told me I had to prove who I am and where I live and wanted a copy of my bank statement and a bill... like NO reason someone from another country should be asking me to identify myself... these creditors should really use American people in there offices and should really be better at there jobs... failed company.,2025-04-04,5

Consumer beware.

Bank is terrible. I unfortunately have two credit cards with this bank. and I feel like there's constant fees sometimes for no reason. My other Credit card lines don't have these fees and i wish i knew it before i signed up for them. I'm trying to pay it off just so I can close it completely because I do not want this bank anymore and the app is glitchy and sometimes it's completely under maintenance and I can't put a payment out there and then I get charged a late fee.,2025-05-04,5

"Extremely inconvenient, card is constantly being declined/locked due to hard to understand reasoning. It got declined/ blocked with no late payments and with plenty of credit available because they deemed a charhe at CVS ""suspicious"". Also the CS reps have been very rude to me, accuse me of being disingenuous, cut me off while I'm explaining, and then criticize me for not letting them finish talking, which they were unable to properly do since I didn't get to finish my point.

"My experience matches many of the irritated people who wrote negative e reviews.

Simple but why no screen shots is dumb. The screenshot is for confirmation #. Proof of payment. I don't understand why no screenshot.

Was excited to get this card. Set up autopay & the 1st payment didn't go through so I was charged a late fee despite having auto pay on. I contacted customer service they were able to reverse $20 of the $29 late fee. Very disappointing to have issues on the 1st month. Hopefully this doesn't happen again. If the developers contact me I won't be able to reply through here & I was told that the late fee is never completely reversed even though they could see I had done everything correctly.,2025-02-17,5

Would be better if you didn't have to pay a fee to pay with your debit card. My other cards I can call the day the bills due or go right on the app and do a debit card payment or right on the phone and do it + the payment goes through right away.

"Nice app, very functional. But when making a payment for the last 12 months the agent on the other end puts up my personal information for me to verify and less than a second later puts a very condescending message telling me to accept the info before I can even read it.

Next time I will most likely sit for a minute or two saying , man you are impatient aren't you?",2024-09-22,5
Good card for building credit. Don't like the fee to pay from debit card instead of bank account. It started at $4.95 then jumped up to $7.95!

"A one time activation fee has nothing to do with the overall quality of the app, I dont understand people complaining about that considering their credit scores probably arent the best. Thats why were all using credit 1 right? The app is convenient, and thats what matters most. I've had no issues with credit 1. Spend under 10% of your credit amount and pay your bill in full on time and your credit will shoot up. If your building credit stop using your cards like a piggy bank, its a tool.",2025-05-10,5
