"Dropping support for older phones, for a banking app, is kind of a lame move, in my opinion, you're making the assumption everyone can afford new phones with new operating systems. Is US Bank gonna buy me a new phone?",2025-05-23,1
the bank screwed me,2025-05-22,1
always non responsive,2025-05-21,1
I never know how much money I have because I get manipulated every week even if I wait for pending transactions I don't recommend,2025-05-21,1
Horrible app. The only app I have problems with. It takes multiple tries to mobile deposit as it kicks me out to the login screen. I can't run into the bank as you shut them all down and the closest one is over 30 minutes away. With no local banks the least you could do is make sure your app is good.,2025-05-20,1
Check Deposit feature does not work properly. Every Deposit is an absolute struggle!,2025-05-20,1
commands like turning on alerts don't work,2025-05-20,1
absolutely the worst customer service/ fraud department I have ever dealt with,2025-05-20,1
"has anyone else been having issues with the mobile deposit. this is my 2nd week with the ""there's a problem on our end try again later"" been like this since the last update",2025-05-19,1
"I really only use this app to do mobile deposits and it does an awful job at it. When you try to take a picture of the check to deposit it just says, ""too bright"" so i turn off the flash and it still says too bright. Then it says, ""hold steady"" so I put my phone on a tripod and it still says, ""hold steady"". Then finally I click the option where you can take a picture yourself and it says, ""success"" but then it logs me out and I have to start the whole process all over again. Take 30+ tries total",2025-05-19,1
"we're sorry this doesn't work... we're sorry that doesn't work... we're sorry... this ""bank"" is terrible.",2025-05-19,1
"Way too many clicks to do basic stuff like deposit a check. Clunky. And asks me twice if I really want to do stuff. Yes and yes. App needs work. they keep updating it, but unfortunately it just doesn't get any better. while there's been a lot of changes and improvements, there's still a lot of problems with the app, especially using zelle on the mobile app. when using memos, there are certain characters you can't use and it's different between the web app experience and the mobile app experience",2025-05-19,1
don't like adds placed over the area needed to access,2025-05-19,1
Whoever decided to enable ad notifications for your terrible services within the app deserves a papercut,2025-05-19,1
Spent an hour trying to deposit a check but it couldn't pick up the endorsement signature. I took photos over and over again with differing backgrounds and light to no avail. Awesome,2025-05-18,1
"nothing but problems!! First it wouldn't let me make an account (already had my card). Now it won't let me transfer my funds into my main account. It's pretty much useless. i can't even enable notifications without getting the ""there was a problem"" message. Keeps saying problem is on their end so at least they know they're useless.",2025-05-18,1

this bank is awful. I've had more problems in the 2 weeks that I've been with them than I have any other bank ever.,2025-05-17,1
horrible,2025-05-17,1
I keep having to uninstall and reinstall the app to get it to work.,2025-05-16,1
it only works about half the time you need it to.,2025-05-16,1
absolutely garbage. was declined with money on the card because of a transaction limit....shouldn't work that way. if I have money I should be able to spend it any way I'd like!,2025-05-15,1
limited DEPOSIT allowance per week,2025-05-15,1
Great app. Very convenient. UPDATE.... This app has turned to garbage. mobile deposit takes half the night to get the pictures taken and submitted... because the app keeps forcing back to the login screen.,2025-05-15,1
"beware of mobile deposit. Tried to deposit a check from capital 1 and it was deducted from my account for the reason of NSF. lol. The banks work together to scam us. How does capitalone not have less than $15 in their account? I attempted an investigation from both parties, the result is USBANK and Capitalone both double down on pointing the finger at each other. I lost about a days worth of work attempting to straighten this out.",2025-05-15,1
Completely unusable.,2025-05-14,1
CANNOT ACTIVATE CARD CANNOT GET CUSTOMER SERVICE BY PHONE OR APP!!!!,2025-05-14,1
worst. bank. ever.,2025-05-14,1
"Very disappointed in US Bank. I've been with them 20+ years & now they're changing my no fee accounts to have fees for the privilege of them holding my money (while they make profits on it in the background). It's just numbers in a ledger! US Bank only wants your business if you're rich, this change takes advantage of poor people! US Bank just lost my business for life & I will be sure to tell everyone I know why too. They don't even have proper 2FA! Go to a Credit Union, you'll be better off.",2025-05-13,1
The interface is all ads. Just trying to get to your account is a chore. That's if you can even login,2025-05-13,1
"Absolutely horrendous customer service. User interface is clunky, account verification rarely works. Don't do business with these people, they will close your account and freeze your assets, refuse to give you a reason and then act like they're doing you a favor. If I could give less than one star I absolutely would.",2025-05-12,1
BALANCE WIDGET IS STILL BROKEN. Over a month now. The only one without ZELLE. It's is on YOUR end it says. STILL NO DARK MODE EITHER.,2025-05-12,1

"bad UI design, unclear instructions, hard to know if I have paid my statement or not.",2025-05-10,1
app does not work well on my android phone. the screen blocks the view on the page after choosing the recipient and the amount which is happ ening right now I'm done typing and I can't get the keyboard to close,2025-05-09,1
"this app sucks, 2 stars because it does most of what I need, just slow as hell and causes inaccurate choices. Look for better app developers, my 14yo builds better apps in highschool. my prev review stands, now these losers put ads in my app, I dismiss, and they come back the next time I open the app. considering changing banks over this nonsense",2025-05-09,1
"Received a letter in the mail stating that if I don't do a transaction within 30 days, my account will be considered 'dormant', and they will deduct a fee each month until I do. It also said that I could transfer any amount online to avoid the fee. I attempted to do that, and the app said I couldn't do it! Very irritating!! Moved most of my money out due to a complete lack of confidence in this bank.",2025-05-09,1
possibly the worst app I ever used. no help whatsoever,2025-05-08,1
It doesn't work anymore. The deposit capture has been broken for over a year. You have to trick it into taking photos because no matter how dark the room is it will say it is Too Bright and won't capture. So after a while you can just manually take the photo. But now even that seems broken and it takes 15 minutes to get a check to go through. Still says too bright no matter where I am two years later. Give us an early exit from the automatic part that doesn't work and just let us take the pic.,2025-05-08,1
"This App has gone downhill since I posted a positive review, giving it 5 stars. Since then, it has done nothing but waste my time waiting and waiting for it to load, then wait for it to allow me to view transactions if I can ever even get to see the transactions! Wth happened to this app? My bank account has now officially been broken into 2x in 3 months, also! Then I had to wait 3 weeks to use my account! Never had a better banking app. Please put up more physical locations for office needs",2025-05-08,1
Allow me to screenshot my own info! Allow me to use a widget for my balance!,2025-05-08,1
"Wow, where to start? Unlike other banks, the debit card does not get sent out until money is recieved. There is a hold on my initial deposit so I'm unable to access my money the day I need it. I spent time on app until it decided to lock me out for attempting to move my money and made me call the line. From there, I had to call twice and was transferred, ultimately I was told they can't help me today. I asked if I went in person if I could get my money. the operator told me yes, but I could not.",2025-05-07,1
"Terrible app, worse service. I utilize a card issued through work for this app and with zero external transfers, piss poor communication skills, and inactive or nonfunctional notifications the list goes on about why everyone choosing not to use this garbageüóëÔ∏è‚úì",2025-05-07,1
SUCKS!,2025-05-07,1
DO NOT USE US BANK mobile deposit does not honor their own checks. customer service. you cannot get a real human on the phone to solve a simple problem. switch to a local credit union so you can do simple things like mobile deposit without delay and/or lapse. you can never talk to a person. they do not care about bankers unless it is in their interest. good luck getting a real person on the phone. cannot pay bills because they do not honor their own checks.,2025-05-07,1
they keep checks hold your deposits i hate this bank and app,2025-05-06,1
"I'm very frustrated and disappointed with the app. Every time I go to do a mobile check deposit, it takes the pictures and logs me out highly disappointed may even switch banks",2025-05-06,1
worst experience ever. I used atm that didn't give my money and bank manager refuses to fix the problem. Simple fix just call Loomis who services the atm and look at the camera. Now I have lost my daughters ashes and storage unit because the bank manager refused to just call Loomis. this could have been handled that day and I would still have my daughters ashes.,2025-05-06,1
"If you try to deposit a check to an account in pending negative, they sometimes block you from doing it on mobile - you have to go to physical ATM. Very convenient indeed. Kinda defeats the whole purpose.",2025-05-06,1
You ask me questions You already know the answers to! Sheeesh! LAMEM!,2025-05-05,1
"I'm not sure what's going on, but almost every time I try to log in here, it's claiming I'm putting the wrong information. As carefully as I check what I'm entering (and the fact that I keep my logins somewhere for reference) this makes no sense. I am tired of having to reset for no reason. I don't have this issue on any of the other many platforms the average person has to maintain at this (ridiculous) point. Update: The issue stopped after my initial review, but now it's doing it again.",2025-05-05,1
I can't take screenshots inside the app. And don't talk to me about safety. check deposit is a rather painful task. Overall not a very convenient app.,2025-05-05,1
After the update if you click anywhere the screen goes white and you cant use the app. If you login the app try's to load something and goes white and you cant use the app,2025-05-03,1

"UPDATE: Still a good app. Very few issues over the years. I'm changing my rating to one star because I've already rated the app but it always asks for a rate when I'm in the middle of important banking, wasting my time. Great mobile banking app. Works well most of the time. Very responsive to input. Great customer service, too.",2025-05-02,1

"My favorite part of this app is playing ""will it work or not"" with it. Will it let me transfer money today or not? Let's find out and be disappointed because 90% of time it doesnt.

My account gets locked out for 24-48 hours EVERY TIME i try to send a zelle despite following their instructions every time i call them and tell them it's the same damn thing and they never tell me what is wrong, what is getting flagged, so i can't even fix the problem because they. wont. tell. me. the online banking experience via this app is why i will no longer be a US bank customer",2025-04-27,1
money was stolen from account u.s. bank did nothing,2025-04-27,1
They lost a $100 deposit. Two weeks after I received notification that it was 'accepted'. After two weeks I had disposed of the check. It said there was a problem with the check images. only there wasn't. they approved the images. and I was able to view them. no issues. they said I had to go and find the check and redeposit it. I said there was no way I threw it away. and I'm not going to drive 200 miles to get a $100 check. I called about 3 or 4 times. zero satisfaction. They owe me $100.,2025-04-27,1
App is actually really good.,2025-04-26,1

"""Remember me"" doesn't work. the app forgets my username and password everytime it's opened. I've had to reset my password half a dozen times and now everything I try says ""your new password can be the same as an old password"". At this point there's no reason to even have an account or password because any time I want to use online banking it has to text me a verification and asks for my social anyways. There are no other benefits to this bank other than it is one nearest to me.",2025-04-26,1
Why did you get rid of the void check download? Not everyone is going to use your automated service for direct deposit. Absolutely ridiculous that you got rid of that and expect people to be forced into using your direct deposit service. So now we have to order a checkbook to get a single check...,2025-04-26,1
good,2025-04-25,1
"Designed for people who do not have many transactions. Duplicate requests to confirm transactions. Non intuitive interface. I can only assume it was designed by people who do not use the app, otherwise they would realize how cumbersome it is.

"user friendly but way too pushy Every time I log in to handle my banking I get pop ups for auto transferring some random amount. There's never any less than 3 ads for various services. Frequent requests to update income (why? Its direct deposit. You know what my income is.) Don't get me wrong. The app is very user friendly. It allows me to check on or do my banking anytime or place. You can easily order checks, change pins or get a new card asap. It's just the app has become so ad heavy now.",2025-05-03,2

"General high-level banking works but pretty limited on capability and very limited on customer support. Pretty much everything I've come to expect from US BANK, bare minimum works but if you want customer service and attention you have to go credit Union or local. 30 year customer and nothing more than a number, but the convenience and breadth of ATM Network, online bill pay, etc. has its advantages. The deposit a check option is a joke, terrible technology.",2025-05-01,2

You can set it but it never saves. I'd recommend the app if you need it, otherwise look elsewhere for the ability to analyze your spending. Additionally, there's no way to report glitches without calling and providing your ssn or going physically to a store which is extremely inconvenient and not great for app development.",2024-09-23,3

It doesn't work anymore. The deposit capture has been broken for over a year. You have to trick it into taking photos because no matter how dark the room is it will say it is Too Bright and won't capture. So after a while you can just manually take the photo. But now even that seems broken and it takes 15 minutes to get a check to go through. Still says too bright no matter where I am two years later. Give us an early exit from the automatic part that doesn't work and just let us take the pic.,2025-05-08,4

DO NOT USE US BANK mobile deposit does not honor their own checks. customer service. you cannot get a real human on the phone to solve a simple problem. switch to a local credit union so you can do simple things like mobile deposit without delay and/or lapse. you can never talk to a person. they do not care about bankers unless it is in their interest. good luck getting a real person on the phone. cannot pay bills because they do not honor their own checks.,2025-05-07,4

"Intuitive app. The things that I do the most are quite easy to find and complete. Downside: when electronically depositing a check, the app has a very hard time with the back of the check- tells me that I need to use a darker background when I am.

"As far as banking apps go, this is my favorite. You can do pretty much anything and transactions appear very quickly, like if you make a credit card payment, it reduces both your payment account and your credit card amount at the same time. The only drawback is that interest rate information on credit products (cards, lines of credit, etc.) isn't always easy to find. Like it shows up for one credit card but not the other and not on the lines at all.",2025-04-08,4

Horrible app. The only app I have problems with. It takes multiple tries to mobile deposit as it kicks me out to the login screen.

It doesn't work anymore. The deposit capture has been broken for over a year. You have to trick it into taking photos because no matter how dark the room is it will say it is Too Bright and won't capture. So after a while you can just manually take the photo. But now even that seems broken and it takes 15 minutes to get a check to go through. Still says too bright no matter where I am two years later.

"General high-level banking works but pretty limited on capability and very limited on customer support. Pretty much everything I've come to expect from US BANK, bare minimum works but if you want customer service and attention you have to go credit Union or local. 30 year customer and nothing more than a number, but the convenience and breadth of ATM Network, online bill pay, etc. has its advantages.

Camera is really fickled I guess is the word I want to use I use other apps like KeyBank and square and I don't have any problems but it seems like the focus for US Bank is very difficult too bright further away in closer the two bright is the most common one that we're having a problem with,2025-02-28,5

Very good,2025-02-26,5
"This app works pretty well. Doesn't crash. Has most of the features you want in a banking app. Some things are missing or hard to find, like rewards redemption on credit cards. Not a big deal though, just go to the website. Update- lost a star down to 3 for two reasons. Mobile check deposit always fails to take a picture of the back of the check. Takes 3-10 tries to get it to work. Second reason, I already gave a review and yet I keep getting more requests to post reviews.",2025-02-25,5
It would be five stars if I could take the photo of my check myself without having to wait for failures. It takes so long to deposit a check because it can't automatically snap the photo for some reason.,2025-02-25,5
"The app is functional enough, but there are a few basic features lacking. For instance, there is no way to see pending payments. My payments sometimes take 3 days to go through, and it can be frustrating trying to remember when (or if) I initiated the transaction. Also whenever I redeem rewards from my credit card to my checking account, I'm required to input the routing # and my checking account # in full. I wish there was a way to select my account from a list since they're all associated.",2025-02-25,5
It's simple just gives you quick balances but when you get your check depoiste disabled it messes up your whole camera and neither should have the right to fo that Period,2025-02-23,5
"The app works well & has some great features such as depositing checks, money transfers and Zelle. My biggest issue is they allow Adobe to send trackers to my phone. ALOT of trackers, more than any of my other apps. Once I saw something like 458 in one hour. When I contacted the bank about it, he left a voice mail stating it's the ""improve customer experience"" ""terms of service"" baloney. Whatever. Certainly doesn't improve my experience, not by a country mile.",2025-02-19,5

"The mobile app by US Bank meets my needs and most all my expectations. It is a little more cluttered than I would prefer, but that's likely because the developers attempted to make the app fit most any user style. That said, the app earns a solid three stars rating. To do better I will have to be at least pleasantly surprised by some portion, option or function of the app. Disappointing me in any way results in lost stars.",2025-02-07,5
