"Every time I try to take the picture of the check I'm depositing it says ""use a dark background"". I'm using a navy background. Since when is NAVY not dark?! Fix your app!",2025-05-18,1
"one of the worst banks on the market pushing false narratives ""set up this with our 3rd party to resolve this but in the meantime time we will take as much of your money out of your account as we please"" this bank is a joke and should have more then the most recent class action lawsuits that's happended 0-10 would not recommend keep your money in a shoe box under your bed would be safer",2025-05-16,1

Can't get into my account Can't get into my account,2025-04-30,1
this bank app updates too often and demands for another app to be deleted in order to update 💔🤬,2025-04-30,1
not available too often,2025-04-27,1
do not use this bank,2025-04-27,1
"this app has become terrible to use for the simplest things. trying to take a photo of a check to deposit may log you out and force you to RESTART your phone just to try and log in again. calling customer service thru the app no longer works if your location for the app is turned off. Use another bank, the harassment for cash deposits alone is enough to close your accounts. my experience has ENDED MEANS I WILL NOT RETURN.",2025-04-25,1
"my husband and I both have an account with them. we're searching for other options. we were told there wasn't a maintenance fee. yet $25 a month comes out of the account and it literally says ""maintenance fee"". before this, the highest maintenance fee I had was $12 and I thought that was a rip off. these guys basically told the other bank to hold their beer.",2025-04-24,1
usually works fine. last 2 days I haven't been able to login online or on the app.,2025-04-21,1
Go to open hit and all it doesn't crash.,2025-04-21,1
"not the app as much as the bank, itself - specifically their Zelle amounts of 1500 per day, which if I really stretch my mind, can remember when that was a lot of money -- I can Zelle up to 10k at Chase - why can't TD???",2025-04-20,1
worst bank ever TD Bank sucks,2025-04-16,1
Fix your app!,2025-04-16,1
stop tracking please.,2025-04-15,1
"Not a good experience at all. The branches are sparse which wouldn't be an issue if I wasn't forced to go to a branch just to get a voided check for my direct deposit, then after repeating myself multiple times still being given a direct deposit form which I could have just printed from the internet and I had already communicated wouldn't be sufficient for my work, ultimately a waste of time and considering the banks poor reputation for customer service these red flags were enough.",2025-04-15,1
had to download as phone number not working when trying to activate card,2025-04-13,1
Idk what happened but since around the time i had to change my cell number the TD bank apk stopped working for me. It keeps logging me out for security reasons even after i went into a TD branch to do an in person verification. It was much easier to access accounts through the apk rather than having to access accounts by signing in online through a browser. All of my other apks function well and i have over 100 on my screen.,2025-04-12,1
td bank isn't the bank they don't care for there customers everything has to do with money if u can't pay be prepare for the fees capital one offers way more comfort then td bank they just a bunch of thieves,2025-04-12,1

td Bank has to the worst way to send zelle because it takes about 7 days to go through when you zelle someone is for them to get the money instantly not 7days later td sucks,2025-04-02,1
I have been trying for OVER ONE YEAR to change my phone number on this app. I have changed it at my bank location but it will still not accept it on my app. I CANNOT FIND MENU on my app either as it doesn't show up. Worst bank app I've ever seen - totally useless. Even Customer Service couldn't find a place on the app to do it.,2025-04-01,1
I cannot log in with this app. When I want to review my account I have to login using web browser only. No issues with username or password there. This app just says it doesn't match so it's useless.,2025-03-31,1
Can't make a mobile deposit,2025-03-31,1
"since the update, I am unable to use the fingerprint scan feature. I have to manually enter the password each time.",2025-03-30,1
Years later you will not let me log in because you will not change my phone number online. What is the point of having the option to change your number when you do not actually change it!? Then you have the audacity to tell people to go to the bank to verify that you are who you say you are! I am willing to find another bank over this nonsense. Remove the option to change your number online if you will leave the number there anyways!,2025-03-27,1
TD bank is trash they don't respect people credit,2025-03-26,1
bad app because I am confused.,2025-03-25,1
my phone isn't compatible with the new app. Galaxy S7 does not apear to have the option to upgrade to OS 9 as app developer suggests. I guess TD is forcing me to biy a new phone?,2025-03-24,1
app isn't working again and I need to check my accounts,2025-03-24,1
"They do not allow biometric login on my phone anymore because I have updated to a newer version of Android than the phone manufacturer officially supports. Apparently TD thinks that using outdated, vulnerable software is better than updating your software by hand. Sure, they can make the excuse that they can't guarantee the reliability and security of custom software, but I guarantee outdated software, which they do support, is also not secure.",2025-03-23,1
"App has consistently not worked correctly since the late 2024/early 2025 update. Login screen regularly freezes up. Sometimes uninstall and reinstall fixes the issue temporarily, but I shouldn't have to redownload an app each time I want to use it. Y'all make way too much money to put out such a poor quality app.",2025-03-23,1
don't use this bank ever. they purposely ruined my credit.,2025-03-22,1
i give td no stars your overdraft sucks like 50 bucks is going to cover your bills when you over draft no,2025-03-22,1
"this app sucks. just like TD bank. keeps saying my Gmail account isn't a valid email. thanks for nothing, Americas most inconvenient bank",2025-03-21,1

you won't let me change my address or telephone number to send me a security code & unlicensed my account. I moved & there is no td branch for me to go to to do this.,2025-03-19,1
"This app and bank are awful. Ever since they got charged with money laundering and fined 3 billion dollars they service has been awful, the fees have doubled and the physical locations are disgusting with trash every where and a single employee. They increased the fee for a basic checking account from $4.99 a month to $9.99 with zero notification. The customer should not have to pay for your poor business decisions. You were found guilty of money laundering, why am I paying for it?",2025-03-18,1
Can't even transfer between accounts. Keeps saying I don't have accounts to transfer between and I have 3 of them,2025-03-17,1

Don't want to install app just to activate card,2025-03-16,1
they raised the maintenance fee's almost double.,2025-03-11,1
"I have reported the 2fa problem to TD Bank for more than 5 years and it still hasn't changed. I'm trying to purchase a flight home, but I literally can't because of 2fa. unless TD wants to pay for an international phone plan for me, then they need to find an alternative for this bulllshit 2fa. I do not want a phone. I do not want to carry a phone on me at all times. it is insane that they are holding my money hostage and keeping me stuck in a foreign country because I can't recieve a text.",2025-03-11,1
Ive read alot of the reviews and none positive. The phone I initially loaded the online app on is broken and not operationa. The app sends am error and asks for verification number but sends that number to the wrong phone to the phone that doesn't work Have no way to access my account,2025-03-10,1
Does not work. Keeps closing. Fix it.,2025-03-10,1
Awful app. Keeps crashing.,2025-03-10,1
Terrible. But I think it is more the phone than the app,2025-03-07,1

I can't sign into my account with my fingerprint anymore and it seems that when I insert my password there is an error I hope this gets fixed.,2025-02-26,1
"SUCKS, use to be good, now when you sign in it will call or text a code and when you go put the code in there is NO place to put it and it makes you sign in again and REPEAT everything else and you get NOWHERE.",2025-02-22,1
Not a good experience! If you're traveling abroad might not be able to use the app at all!,2025-02-21,1
I am having trouble with this update. Repeatedly I've tried to lookup my routing number and account number but the app will close instead of showing the result.,2025-02-19,1
"Multiple issues with the app. For one, it doesn't respect the ""default account"" as the online webpage does. So when you make a bill payment, it is easy to overdraft your account by accident (definitely a $ making scheme). You can't make principal mortgage payments through the app. You must call in/email then each time you transfer $ toward your mortgage. Furthermore, if you have an unlocked bootloader, but are not rooted, they punish you with disabling fingerprint login.",2025-02-15,1
Everytime you actually need to use the app for something important they are updating or under maintenance. Get used to it.,2025-02-15,1
Worse than useless. TD Bank has horrible software engineers who can't figure out how to make final automatic payments that were agreed to in writing at the time of the loan. The qpp shows the wrong payoff amount allowing TD to charge extra interest. App changes and payments take up to two weeks to shoe..even for just an address change. This delay allows TD to claim they sent out a notice that they unilaterally changed payment process . TD should be fined for having an app this awful,2025-02-14,1
"This app is so slow now since the update. Takes forever to load and more than half the time it won't load my bank statements. It's making me want to leave TD and switch to a bank where I can use the actual app. Also, it's almost 2025, why do we still not have a TD auto finance app? Update 2/13: This app is absolutely horrible. The thing never works. Never loads. My screen times out before I can even see my statements. I think at this point it's time to switch banks.",2025-02-14,1
App keeps crashing. It doesn't let me in my account. I can only get to my account by direct website so there's really no point in having the app,2025-02-11,1

"This has to be the worst banking experience I ever had. I think im going to file a discrimination suit against TD BANK. So .. I went in there originally to buy a cashiers check. The head manager told me I can't buy a cashiers check unless I had an account. I went to the post office and brought money orders. I was happy because I got excepted for a new home. Unfortunately Ms Maria Gencarelli, had me sign the lease and decided she had a change of hart and wasn't going to give me the apartment.",2025-01-30,1
"This app is virtually unusable because, despite having a 'Remember Me' option, it still requires users to enter their full password every time they log in. This is extremely inconvenient, especially for those who don't memorize complex 16-character alphanumeric passwords with symbols.",2025-01-28,1

"I would give this zero stars if I could. Locked out of my account and I can only visit a branch. Problem is I live abroad so that's impossible. Horribly operated bank, who came up with their security systems.",2025-01-08,1
"I can't believe they updated the login screen, breaking password autofill in the process, and STILL have not fixed it. This is a security issue. Autofill is more secure than clipboard where any app can access it, and breaking that is NOT ok, besides for the extra inconvenience of not having the popup right there. Please fix this. Edit: still a problem in 2025. set your autofill hints in your view or your compose components. Few lines for massive security and QoL improvement",2025-01-07,1
Issues with zelle service,2025-01-03,1
"It doesn't work on my phone anymore and there are no alternatives I can see. It used to work but then without warning, they changed it. I was perfectly happy with the older app. This is not only useless to me, it's an inconvenience.",2025-01-02,1
"Horrible, useless app. Mobile deposit NEVER WORKS.",2024-12-31,1

Not just that, but they have no way of giving it back other than mailing a check, which could get lost in the mail!

Idk what happened but since around the time i had to change my cell number the TD bank apk stopped working for me. It keeps logging me out for security reasons even after i went into a TD branch to do an in person verification. It was much easier to access accounts through the apk rather than having to access accounts by signing in online through a browser. All of my other apks function well and i have over 100 on my screen.,2025-04-12,2

I have been trying for OVER ONE YEAR to change my phone number on this app. I have changed it at my bank location but it will still not accept it on my app. I CANNOT FIND MENU on my app either as it doesn't show up.

Years later you will not let me log in because you will not change my phone number online. What is the point of having the option to change your number when you do not actually change it!? Then you have the audacity to tell people to go to the bank to verify that you are who you say you are! I am willing to find another bank over this nonsense.

Everytime you actually need to use the app for something important they are updating or under maintenance. Get used to it.,2025-02-15,2
Worse than useless. TD Bank has horrible software engineers who can't figure out how to make final automatic payments that were agreed to in writing at the time of the loan. The qpp shows the wrong payoff amount allowing TD to charge extra interest. App changes and payments take up to two weeks to shoe..even for just an address change. This delay allows TD to claim they sent out a notice that they unilaterally changed payment process . TD should be fined for having an app this awful,2025-02-14,2

Worse than useless. TD Bank has horrible software engineers who can't figure out how to make final automatic payments that were agreed to in writing at the time of the loan. The qpp shows the wrong payoff amount allowing TD to charge extra interest. App changes and payments take up to two weeks to shoe..even for just an address change. This delay allows TD to claim they sent out a notice that they unilaterally changed payment process . TD should be fined for having an app this awful,2025-02-14,3

So when you make a bill payment, it is easy to overdraft your account by accident (definitely a $ making scheme). You can't make principal mortgage payments through the app. You must call in/email then each time you transfer $ toward your mortgage.

Everytime you actually need to use the app for something important they are updating or under maintenance. Get used to it.,2025-02-15,4
Worse than useless. TD Bank has horrible software engineers who can't figure out how to make final automatic payments that were agreed to in writing at the time of the loan. The qpp shows the wrong payoff amount allowing TD to charge extra interest. App changes and payments take up to two weeks to shoe..even for just an address change. This delay allows TD to claim they sent out a notice that they unilaterally changed payment process . TD should be fined for having an app this awful,2025-02-14,4
"This app is so slow now since the update. Takes forever to load and more than half the time it won't load my bank statements.

Worse than useless. TD Bank has horrible software engineers who can't figure out how to make final automatic payments that were agreed to in writing at the time of the loan. The qpp shows the wrong payoff amount allowing TD to charge extra interest. App changes and payments take up to two weeks to shoe..even for just an address change. This delay allows TD to claim they sent out a notice that they unilaterally changed payment process . TD should be fined for having an app this awful,2025-02-14,5

App works fine but TD's entire online presence obscures valuable information with no way to find it outside of their paper statements.

"the than Astoria and chemical Bank account and some others I had. It also my latest bank and now for 5 years or so,this bank has gotten better since my first opinion of this bank. They never give me a hard time. My word is always accepted the first time. I have online banking which I pay my bills. Any debit from my account that I don't recognize is debited back to my account by the bank, which I personally find that is amazing. There is no other bank in my 74 years ever did that for me. Great!",2024-12-07,5
