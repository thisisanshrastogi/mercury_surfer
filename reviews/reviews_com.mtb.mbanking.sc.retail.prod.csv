I can hardly ever use the app. mine always pops up and says mobile banking unavailable. I cant even get into the screen to log in. I make sure that my app is always updated and it still happens.,2025-05-23,1
It's fundamentally unreliable at a rate that is shocking for a major bank. I think they decided the money would be better spent on stadium naming rights.,2025-05-21,1
Usually had no issues but today it constantly says that the app is corrupt. I've deleted and reinstalled three times now and it still says the same thing.,2025-05-21,1
App is corrupted!!!!,2025-05-21,1
Zelle in the update is unsuable because it tries to pull from your entire contact list. It cycles forcing to relogin or crash the app. Let us send to phone number without adding to contacts please.,2025-05-21,1
file is now corrupt and can not open the app at all deleted and reinstalled multiple times just continue being corrupt. maybe it's time to leave m&t,2025-05-21,1
"I never even got as far as logging in. When you install the application it wants you to ""give permission"" and it will collect a list of applications installed on your device. When that popup appeared I wasn't even sure if this app was legitimate and immediately uninstalled.",2025-05-20,1
this app is not good m&t bank they use outdated technology and all the time system is down,2025-05-17,1
"check deposit constantly say it's ""unavailable, please try again later"". app is updated on my end. called customer service and they say nothing is wrong on their end, or with my account and they're sorry, but I'll have to go to a branch. what good is a banking app if you can't do deposit? Update - The canned reply from m&t to my review is worse than no reply at all. if you actually read it, I already stated I had updated to latest app, and I called customer service. zero stars",2025-05-10,1
No legitimate reason to require location permission. App auto-exits if you refuse location permissions.,2025-05-09,1
"This app regularly displays late or incorrect information. Edit: Even with the ""latest"" updates, this app still does not do its job correctly. Edit: one year later and your app is still buggy and doesn't work correctly. It never displays correct/current information.",2025-05-07,1
It is allways asking me to uninstal and download it again each week.I can not open it easily.It is freezed,2025-05-03,1
"** UPDATE 4/30/25: Having to get a code every time I logged in was frustrating enough, now, text is no longer an option. Options are push notification or an email. And, of course, push notification doesn't work. UGH!! Used to love being able to access my accounts on my phone. Got a new phone & installed the app. Now, I have to get a code every single time I try to log in. What's the point of having a password & fingerprint enabled login if I have to get a code every time??!! SOOOO frustrating.",2025-05-01,1
Terrible app works once then you have to delete and download again to work.,2025-04-29,1
"Someone else pointed it out, but this app just Does Not Work on a Moto G Power 2025. I have no idea why but you open the app and immediately get a ""Temporarily Unavailable"" pop-up, there is no way to troubleshoot it, clearing the cache, uninstalling and reinstalling doesn't work, I've called customer service to figure this out twice and both times the helper has been stumped. It's been a month since I changed phones, this issue should've been resolved the moment the bug was found. Fix your app.",2025-04-28,1
way to difficult and never works,2025-04-28,1
"The last several times I've tried to mobile deposit a check (the main reason for having the app) I get a message saying I was logged out for being inactive for 5 minutes. The process didn't even take 5 minutes. So, there is a technical glitch and an inaccurate error message.",2025-04-25,1
never works,2025-04-23,1
This app does not run on a 2025 Moto g power. I've tried multiple devices of this make and model. Works on every other android device I've tried. Very frustrating.,2025-04-22,1
"They finally fixed mobile deposit, after a month of it not working. Will definitely be switching to a different bank whenever possible.",2025-04-21,1
"Horribly unusable, get a real app developer for God's sake, it's a bank app where you can't even deposit a check! Pathetic excuse for software and waste of time.",2025-04-20,1
intrusive app to collect data,2025-04-18,1
sucks,2025-04-17,1
This mobile app is useless. Recently cloned all my apps to a new phone and this app gives an error that mobile banking is unavailable. Even after I uninstalled the cloned app and reinstall the latest app from the Google play store keep getting the same error.,2025-04-13,1
"love m&t, not the app. it objects to my settings but idk what they need. can't begin to use it. won't let me.",2025-04-11,1
trash customer service. Offer Zelle through the app then when you finally have to use it they trigger a fraud and tell you try again in 48hrs,2025-04-09,1
The amount of permissions this app requires is a serious invasion of privacy. They want a list of all your apps along with your complete search history. An app to a bank to make payments on a loan does not need all of that information.,2025-04-07,1
They want too much access to your phone.,2025-04-01,1
horrible,2025-03-29,1
my mortgage was sold to this bank. The app doesn't work. The website doesn't work. This is a bank........right?,2025-03-28,1
"Constantly under maintenance and unusable. Other bank apps are NEVER ""temporarily unavailable""",2025-03-27,1
dysfunctional garbage app. flags everything you try to do as fraud and offers no 2 factor authentication to bypass. how on God's green Earth are there still banks that don't have the faintest idea of how to handle security? I hate M&T with a passion and cannot wait for the day that I have time to kill my account with them. Monumental waste of time and energy to work with this garbage company. Edit: it is the most recent version! Unfortunately you can't hide behind that.,2025-03-26,1
app is down for logging in purposes yet the website is perfectly usable on a web browser. m and t bank needs to fix its servers for the app.,2025-03-23,1
banking system is horrible. you need to verify every single time. their system is always down. they are hard to reach. shoot i got some stories. never dealing with this bank ever again,2025-03-22,1
can't even complete a $275 zelle transfer. wait on hold for 30 minutes and still no help. tell me to try again in 48 hours.,2025-03-22,1
"3/21/2025 App has another bug When you enter the verification code and hit continue, the app closes and the next thing you find yourself on the phone homepage. As usual, MTB says there's nothing wrong. SURE!!!",2025-03-22,1
why does this app need to have permission to manage and make phone calls from my phone and have to know my location in order for me to have access to use the app. not cool or appropriate for a user. needs to change that immediately.,2025-03-20,1
Need to know too much! Why all apps on phone?? Discontinuing use of mobile app.,2025-03-14,1
"App is offline alot for ""updates"" if you apply for a loan you get sent to a browser page and if approved via email no one will reach out. Scam bank all around avoid",2025-03-11,1
Worst app ever. Can Not do almost all necessary banking tasks on the app. It forwards to the website. Which requires an emailed code. The app then logs you out when you log into the website. When you go to log in the app. It requires another emailed code to log in.,2025-03-09,1
"For as large of a bank M & T is, you would think they'd have a well working app. Unfortunately this app freezes more than the arctic, won't deposit checks, etc. It's should be embarrassing for M & T",2025-03-04,1
Can't get M& TBanking apt,2025-03-03,1
"This app is complete and utter GARBAGE!!! It's constantly in a state of malfunction. Either you cannot login or if you do get in the system, it's down, and you can't complete any online banking tasks at all. To get any kind of help you have to call the ""help line"" and guess what....they can't help you either!!",2025-03-02,1
Works fine on my old Motorola phone. New Motorola phone the app won't load and just keeps saying M&T mobile banking temporarily unavailable. App is loading on old phone!! What's the problem here,2025-03-01,1
"My time has value, this app wasted my time, therefore this app stole from me. Required unnecessary permissions and then delivered 0 functionality",2025-02-26,1
"This app should have 0 stars. It consistantly logs me out during a moblie deposit. I just logged in and went straight to it with my check already signed. That is not 5 minutes long, in fact it can take less than a minute. It wont let me use zelle either so I have quite a few issues",2025-02-25,1
The app and online banking are constantly down in the evening. Don't have this issue with any of my other banks and their apps.,2025-02-23,1
"Terrible app. Requires my location to even login? No thanks. New to this bank since they bought my mortgage, but no thanks.",2025-02-22,1
This is the worst banking app I have ever had the pleasure to use. Bank to bank transfer system is totally broke. Horrible customer service. No response to online messaging and finding a competent over the phone representative is impossible. Don't open an account at this inferior bank.,2025-02-21,1
I reset my password and it still locks my account. This app sucks,2025-02-21,1
"Didn't even get to begin using the app, as the very first step during app onboarding is to give the banking app a slew of unnecessary permissions. These are not optional, it is either enable them or exit the app. I'm exiting and uninstalling the app. Guess I'm limited to the web portal.",2025-02-20,1
They want access to to All your info before you can even open the app. I am forced to use them because my home loan is now managed through this app. I hate it!,2025-02-20,1
"Have m&t banking app on computer, phone & 2 tablets. When tried to use on my phone stated wrong password. How do I fix? Very annoying",2025-02-19,1
"The level of of intrusion relating to your personal information, thier high level of device access, and more far outweighs the benefits....I can't even use the app without them having the ability to manage my phone calls (one of the permissions they ask for).",2025-02-17,1
This bank makes negative effort in helping you open an account.,2025-02-14,1
"Well, it's a useless app. You cannot review details about the mortgage, nor makepayments thru the app, it directs to a website.... So, I saved the website and deleted the app.",2025-02-14,1
You can edit your bank statements that should be against the law,2025-02-14,1
Android app is not connecting,2025-02-12,1
"4 years of the same problem. Gotta open, close, open the app just to be able to sign in at all. And I haven't been able to cash checks by the app in two years, either. M&T, get it together and fix the app! And I DO have the most recent version installed! My boyfriend has the same issue and he JUST got a new phone.",2025-02-12,1
Makes 100s of millions but can't make an app that works.,2025-02-11,1
The card always declined,2025-02-10,1
Terrible.,2025-02-07,1
Half the time I try to load the app it just hangs there trying to login indefinitely. This issue has been ongoing for YEARS. M&T. Garbage app. Garbage bank!,2025-02-07,1
Would not proceed to letting me log in without allowing permissions to make and manage phone calls. Not necessary for a banking app. 1 star,2025-02-07,1
So incredibly invasive an app I didn't even contemplate using it. Read the permissions request and immediately deleted it. There is absolutely *****Zero***** reason for my bank to ask me for a list of installed apps on my phone.,2025-01-29,1
It won't open dependibly. Only works after several attempts. If it all. Aggravating!!!,2025-01-24,1
BS app doesn't need to know what all apps are on my phone.. give account info and that's it.. it doesn't need information on my phone about what apps I have and exc..,2025-01-22,1
It would be great to not be asked to verify identity EVERY SINGLE TIME LOGGING IN... I have a fingerprint setup among other things to avoid that BS. Get with the times,2025-01-21,1
Just a overall bad app and bad bank,2025-01-21,1
Mobile deposits are no longer working. Forgot my fingerprint access. Update: my new question is: is this app ever working?!? Are you really sorry for the inconvenience because it doesn't seem so. Thinking it's time to find a new bank.,2025-01-16,1
Fix your app!!!!!,2025-01-16,1
Stopped working,2025-01-16,1
It's terrible 😤😤,2025-01-16,1
"Bad bank, and even worse app. Is down every single time you need to use it. And it is down way too much. People's United Bank. Was so much better. M&T is a garbage bank.",2025-01-16,1
lucky if it opens. still not fixed,2025-01-16,1
"This app is a joke. Half the time, it doesn't work, or it freezes.",2025-01-16,1
App always crashing or can't use etc etc,2025-01-16,1
"This app never works, it's always unavailable. Im really ready to leave after all the hell m&t has put me through canceling my card and rejecting my paychecks. You guys need to do better.",2025-01-16,1
"The app keeps saying retry,please fix this problem.",2025-01-15,1
"This app is CONSTANTLY down for maintenance. It's basically every single day. Today, I went to transfer money to eat lunch, and I'm unfortunately writing this review instead. If you use mobile banking on the regular bank with someone else.",2025-01-15,1
Used to be a good app. Not so much anymore offline more than it's online. Temporarily unavailable,2025-01-15,1
Alway an unexpected error or mobile banking unavailable,2025-01-15,1
It requires permission to access and control phone calls. I don't need another app controlling my phone.,2025-01-15,1
I'm very disappointed. Doesn't work. They need to fire the programmer.,2025-01-15,1
"This app is constantly getting worked on, updated and down too much for it have no improvements if anything they're going backwards",2025-01-12,1
Worst bank app.,2025-01-09,1
"App won't even let me log in 80% of the time. Constant error messages. Used to work fine, how many steps back do you need to do?",2025-01-04,1
"Mobile banking and banking has gone down hill, M&T started good but now I'm looking to go to a credit union, electronic deposits are slow as a few days to go through, my wife has 802 and we get paid by the same place she gets her deposits several days before me. So I'm switching. Sorry M&T but you are making money off our pay by withholding our money for days and that's wrong.",2025-01-02,1
"The app hardly ever works, I rarely make it to the login screen.",2024-12-31,1
"After the last update, logs in sometimes, but usually just crashes. Repeatedly tried deleting cache, uninstalling then reinstalling, no change. Like we need another reason to dump M&T Bank, possibly the worst bank in the US! Running Android 12.",2024-12-31,1
It doesn't work more than it does,2024-12-21,1
Never loads even opened.,2024-12-21,1
"Can't do anything unless you go into bank not useful in an emergency. 37 Been with this Bank since I was 18, will cancel my account and never use it again!!! Worst ever just like the rest. Stand together and hold these illegal entities responsible!!!",2024-12-21,1
"Frustrating to say the least. Like other comments it's useless. In my case I can't even sign in! Keeps telling me my ID and/or Passcode is incorrect. But it's NOT! Works perfectly on website.... Tried reset, reinstall, etc.. nothing works. Support no help. No one can tell me if problem is App, router settings, my Carriers settings, or something else.... It simply DOES NOT WORK ON MY PHONE (S24+)",2024-12-20,1
Hit or miss if it even let's you sign in,2024-12-17,1
"I don't understand how the app is never available in the morning when we need it. You had all night to do any updates! You make me sick, M&T! I will be leaving once I transfer my deposit to your company.",2024-12-17,1
Awful bank and app,2024-12-17,1
"This is the worst bank, always a problem to login in the app, paychecks deposit by 8am in the morning, other banks shows the balance immediately your employer pays you. Always a problem with zelle.",2024-12-17,1
"Will not load or let me check my bank account, the bank itself has been depositing my pay checks later and later the app and the bank both aren't worth the headache, bad banks like this one are the reason online banks are so much better",2024-12-15,1
Slow or no logon. Access is Temporary unavailable quite often,2024-12-14,1
Constantly unavailable.... why even have an app?,2024-12-13,1
It a horrible Ape I'm unable to long in to my bank account I have called the bank and they can't help me I don't even know my balance it's a horrible ape I want to change banks because I can't budget my money if I don't know my balance,2024-12-13,1
Absolutely the worst banking app I've ever used.,2024-12-11,1
Never opens when needed,2024-12-10,1
Why do you need phone management and location management?,2024-12-09,1

"In 2024, it is unacceptable to have a bank account that is completely inaccessible via mobile app. I deleted the app multiple times & reinstalled it. I still have the same message & can't access my account via mobile device. I will be moving all accounts to a bank that understands the requirements of modern banking include a viable mobile application",2024-12-07,1
To hard to use and allow,2024-12-03,1
Requires access to my entire phone and apps!,2024-12-02,1
App keeps locking me out asking me to reverify myself even after using my fingerprint and password,2024-12-01,1
I would like to know what kind of finacial experience consumers have had with this bank. Just curious?,2024-11-30,1
Worst experience I ever had including security breaches theft stalking identity theft and harassment of not to mention terrorism and migrant criminal activity and also cyber security and safety of your life. Putting you in danger of kidnapping rape and family child protection.death disease and war,2024-11-27,1
"Mobile app would glitch and reset every time I tried to deposit a small check. I uninstalled and went to reinstall just to see that they collect all of your personal information, your location data, as well as information about every single app you have downloaded on your phone if you choose to use their app. Seems extremely intrusive and not a valid way to identify your customers.",2024-11-26,1
Doesn't work half the time,2024-11-25,1
"Giving the app 1 rating until few things fixed (1) ATM needs to have ability to get your BALANCE in the same single transition w/ either deposit/withdrawal, like when u go to the teller. It's 2024 & u guys supposedly had reputation of being super high tech. WTH. What is so hard. I had banks that did this over a decade ago. People have been complaining a while. (2) Stop closing banks in Stop&Shop. If you're going to close the banks, expand the hours of reg branches. Leave/open ATM In the absence",2024-11-20,1
"Back again. Yall finally got the logging in fixed, but now whenever I try to deposit a check your app doesn't register dark backgrounds. It keeps saying use a dark background while I try it on my black microwave, leather jacket, my black dishwasher. I turn the lights on and off. Just need to fix the app. I'm not calling or emailing.",2024-11-19,1
Too many issues in this app make it unusable and this isn't about the version of the app. The issues are consistent even on the most recent update. The Zelle feature in your app is one of the most unstable features and fails to load. Log On is an issue as well. Please take accountability and do better.,2024-11-19,1
Horrible app. I can't log in even with 8 tries from this app. The app has multiple hidden permissions that are hard to un- permission the rest of them. Switch accounts is also a pain. Over bad UI and the UX team should understand how modern and more updated color schemes help people nav through the menu. Please help me to gain back access to my account and money that is missing.,2024-11-13,1
Money Smart error message in online and mobile banking and app 11/11/24. Not able to view or edit money smart content. Very upset. No answer at support number for holiday.,2024-11-12,1
Terrible App. Too intrusive Why does any app need a list of apps installed on my phone. This app should be banned by Google. I'm going to take my friends' advice and close my account at M&T bank.,2024-11-08,1
Having problems paying my car loan app is making me do something that I don't need to do,2024-11-07,1
"Where is the ability to download ststements.. Wouldnt it been more expedient with Your reply of ""contact for Assistance"" to just reply with the actual answer?",2024-11-07,1
Banks do not need to know your location or have access to you calls in order to function properly.,2024-11-04,1
"It doesn't work more often than it does... For it being something that you NEED to manage your money, it's pretty upsetting that this has been like this for years and yet they have yet to fix it even though you can see the countless number of complaints on here and many more in sure made via phone call",2024-11-03,1
"Between all the banks I use, Chase, ESL and even a smaller FCU, this by far is the least optimized app. The fact the app directs you to a web browser for transactions or account functions instead of just using the app itself is a bit inexcusable in 2024. A user should be able to complete all, or at the very least most functions of a banking app within the app without being redirected. You have the funds to develop a stellar app, just seems like corporate greed/laziness truly.",2024-11-02,1
Everytime I go to use this app it won't open. I reinstalling to make it work. You get -10 if I could,2024-11-02,1
Tired of 2 step verify even though it is NOT turned on.... this bank is HORRIBLE. HOLDS USINESS CHECKS FOR A WEEK. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME USING THIS BANK. I had to File grievances with the state comptroller and attorney general. These acts are 100% ILLEGAL. DO NOT USE M&T!!!!!!,2024-11-01,1
"It keeps reversing all my payments without notifying me, leaving me to find out the next bill cycle. I don't want this negatively affecting my credit score, I'd rather know within 24 hours so I can fix it quickly and stay on top of things.",2024-10-28,1
Too invasive requires too many permissions I can't use the app without location services enabled now? Screw it just using browser from now on.,2024-10-27,1
"I've been an m&t customer for 15 years now. I always deposit my checks via Mobile bank so I can keep my check as a pay stub record. From time to time I do need need immediate availability for my money with today's tough economy so I can get bills paid before the weekend. Now I can go into the bank and cash it for no fee and deposit that cash on the spot for immediate availability. So why is it the app has to charge me $18.50 to do this? The larger the check, the more they charge. Profiting on us",2024-10-25,1
"Update: my apps are set to automatically update overnight. Having the latest version shouldn't be an issue. This app required locations services to be active every single time simply to log in. It also requires several other things beyond any other bank or credit card app. Not only did this app get deleted, closing my accounts with m&t is my top priority. They are far too invasive.",2024-10-23,1
Still haven't been able to open the app or login to my online banking. It's been 6 months. The bankers can't help me. The customer service support can't help me. Looking at different banks. I can't even get on Zelle because they are linked with M&T and just tell me to log into my m&t account. 👍,2024-10-22,1
"This app really sucks. Because of it, I am going to refinance my vehicle with another bank. It's ridiculous!",2024-10-21,1
It's probably the worst fraud dept. Of any bank. I hear Northwest doesn't have such a failed fraud policy. I get declined at an atm I frequent every week because they think it's fraud. I've called about this issue and was assured it wouldn't happen again. But it has many times.,2024-10-15,1
Too hard to see. Can't navigate easily to see transactions. Forced to use Zelle through the app and it's not as good.,2024-10-12,1

"Requires access to call logs, list of installed apps, and location awareness. No thanks.",2024-10-02,1
"App works like 35 percent of the time. There's literally no reason a major bank should have an app that crashes or is down this much. I'm thinking of changing my bank solely for that reason. It's down that much. Edit: it was updated it just didn't work, get off my review.",2024-10-01,1
"Couldn't even begin to use the app because I'm not allowing ALL permissions-why is permission for my camera, contacts, to make phone calls needed?? Location (not really) and notifications were all the permissions that are needed. Just uninstalled the app. Will stick to the online platform and just pay bills through my own bank's bill pay.",2024-09-26,1
App crashes while trying to access account. Do not have this problem with my other bank apps! Useless app.,2024-09-25,1
"App won't open. Just sits at splash screen. Also from previous use, this app asks for too many permissions. There's no reason location should be needed for this type of app unless looking for nearby ATMs. Storage should not be needed either unless you're storing or reading data from the phone. Contacts should not be needed either. Your mobile website does not work either. Impossible to log in. Keep getting an error about wrong passcode or username. Works on desktop tho",2024-09-25,1
"App is broken. For whatever reason, my fingerprint login isn't working. My password was a long, confusing mess, so I'm trying to reset it. That doesn't work. Clicking - forgot password - just sends me back to the home screen. Really instills confidence in a bank when their app doesn't even work.",2024-09-23,1
doesn't work.. very upsetting,2024-09-21,1
Why do you need to control my phone calls? I'll stick to walking into the branch.,2024-09-17,1
This app is dysfunctional it horrible,2024-09-14,1
Just updated the app and now I can't log in.,2024-09-13,1

True trash. Wish I could finding the owners of this company just to spit in there faces,2024-09-10,1
"This is the worst bank I have ever dealt with in regard to customer service. Every phone call is 2 hours waiting. I downloaded the app to avoid this, and now I can't even adjust the payment on file without calling. It should never be a concern if I can remove a payment method from my own account. I have to message you here because customer service can't be contacted. Pathetic. I would never recommend this bank.",2024-09-09,1
This app should not require location and phone permissions. Just use normal 2fa like everyone else. This forced me to uninstall and seriously consider switching banks. Previous history with this app has also been terrible.,2024-09-08,1
ALWAY A DAMN UPDATE!,2024-09-08,1
Too much information is online today. Banking should be done at the bank due to its personal nature.,2024-09-08,1

"If I could I would rate 0 stars The bank itself is terrible. I have my funds available less than half of the time after depositing my check. As for the app, I literally have to reset my password anytime I try to log in and then it tries to redirect me to chrome where it says it's the incorrect password. The bank also does not put temporary holds back into your account and if you get paid twice in one week they take payments from both checks for one purchase and lie when you dispute it",2024-09-07,1

Absolutely unusable. Click Enroll & the app closes every time. SMH REPLY - It was the lastest update. Deleted app & reinstalled. Issue remains. App is unusable.,2024-09-03,1
"Save yourself the trouble and just use the full site. You would think that the profits made, they could afford to finally fix this app?.

I've experimented testing it at different times just in case it was a server overload issue. Still doesn't work 9/10 times.

This is the worst mobile bank app ever. I'm going on 2 months using this bank app. First I need to identify myself by 1 finger print. 2 security questions. 3 send code. And enter it just to check my balance. I understand security. But this is to much of a pain. And getting your direct deposit 2 day's early. Not once in 8 pay week's. I totally recommend not using this bank I'm leaving.... -1 star,2024-07-30,1
"App is terrible. It never works. Look at all the other reviews. Might need to switch banks. Mobile banking is unavailable all the time! Bank responds with ""make sure you are in the latest version"".... We are all on the latest version! Fix your app!",2024-07-29,1
"This piece of junk app rarely ever works. It constantly says that mobile banking is either down or unavailable. For a rather large bank, you'd think they'd put just a tiny bit of effort into making sure their app runs.",2024-07-28,1
"""Mobile Banking Temporarily unavailable"" about 70% of the time trying to use the app. This company is a joke.",2024-07-28,1
Why do I have to get an email verification code everytime I login to the app? That's just stupid,2024-07-28,1
"Mobile Banking is temporarily unavailable alot of times , the app constantly glitches and mobile is out of order when you need it the most , mobile banking should always be up and running for people who depend on it",2024-07-26,1

App kicks you out constantly after only seconds. Zelle function doesn't work at all. Glitchy and unreliable,2024-07-12,1
I update this app it always crashes it's very buggy and never works when I want it to It's very upsetting cuz I want to keep this Bank but I can't see my account balance or activities,2024-07-11,1
Never works...,2024-07-10,1
Why it's not optional to give you permission to access everything on my phone?,2024-07-07,1

"I don't like it. Why did it change. That is all I want, is to see, like I use to , what my account looks like. Now, it has all this extra involved.",2024-07-05,1
This app needs work. I have to force stop this app before each use and reopen it to get it to work properly. I've called the bank several times and no one there seem to know how to fix it. It all began when they introduced the new splash screen a couple years ago. That one flaw make the whole app ineffective.,2024-07-05,1
"Great for checking your account and how much you have, but not for much else. Mobile deposit is so buggy I can't deposit my paychecks. First time, it says the amount I entered is not correct, when it is; when I try again, the app breaks and says that I've been in it for longer than 5 minutes and it signs me out.",2024-07-03,1
Doesn't work half the time. Can't log in or can't connect,2024-07-03,1
The app itself seems good. The bank is the problem. Does'nt keep acurate amount. You will see one thing than next day is completely different. And it messes up your account. I zelled money to cover my mortgage payment because there wasn't enough. I did this before the mortgage payment went through last night. Get on today it was returned. Saying it went through the day before and was returned. Before the zelle. UM NO IT DID NOT... Thank you for messing up my account and mortgage loan m&t for $7,2024-07-02,1
"Garbage app that constantly says mobile banking is unavailable, when it's made zero effort to contact the servers. Go on the website and everything is fully function. Useless App.",2024-07-01,1
The app won't launch from a fresh install: 'Mobile banking unavailable'. It also requires too many permissions on the device. No banking app needs to have a list of installed applications on the phone. This is broken and not worth downloading.,2024-07-01,1
Super glitchy- often down on the first of the month.,2024-07-01,1
ALWAYS DOWN,2024-07-01,1
"Doesn't work about 95% of the time, it just says ""mobile banking unavailable"" Better off just using the website.

What a waste of time that would be, is your support line going to make the app work suddenly.",2024-07-01,1

It doesn't let you set up auto pay,2024-06-27,1
"The app has always been great until about 2 months ago. I havent been able to do anything on it. I can't view my account. I can't pay my mortgage. Nothing. Just says, ""Something went wrong"". I've reinstalled it many times, I've restarted my phone, I've cleared my data and cache. Nothing has worked.",2024-06-26,1
Ridiculous that a major bank cannot get an app that actually works in 2024. I'm more angry with the lack of communication regarding this issue and the template response given.,2024-06-24,1
Sometimes I have to close and open to 10 or 20 times to get past the loading screen.,2024-06-23,1
Your app suckDonKFYDICJB,2024-06-23,1
"Again? Not working at all... ridiculous. June 2024 App has not worked for almost 2 weeks. When I called assistance last week I was told that it's because I have an Android and they were ""working on it"" but couldn't give me a time frame . I've uninstalled and reinstalled multiple times.

App is horrible it constantly doesn't connect and I have to reinstall just to login,2024-06-21,1
The app never works. Never able to sign in.,2024-06-20,1
I can hardly ever use the app. mine always pops up and says mobile banking unavailable. I cant even get into the screen to log in. I make sure that my app is always updated and it still happens.,2025-05-23,2
It's fundamentally unreliable at a rate that is shocking for a major bank. I think they decided the money would be better spent on stadium naming rights.,2025-05-21,2
Usually had no issues but today it constantly says that the app is corrupt. I've deleted and reinstalled three times now and it still says the same thing.,2025-05-21,2
App is corrupted!!!!,2025-05-21,2
Zelle in the update is unsuable because it tries to pull from your entire contact list. It cycles forcing to relogin or crash the app. Let us send to phone number without adding to contacts please.,2025-05-21,2
file is now corrupt and can not open the app at all deleted and reinstalled multiple times just continue being corrupt. maybe it's time to leave m&t,2025-05-21,2
"I never even got as far as logging in. When you install the application it wants you to ""give permission"" and it will collect a list of applications installed on your device. When that popup appeared I wasn't even sure if this app was legitimate and immediately uninstalled.",2025-05-20,2
this app is not good m&t bank they use outdated technology and all the time system is down,2025-05-17,2
"check deposit constantly say it's ""unavailable, please try again later"". app is updated on my end. called customer service and they say nothing is wrong on their end, or with my account and they're sorry, but I'll have to go to a branch. what good is a banking app if you can't do deposit? Update - The canned reply from m&t to my review is worse than no reply at all. if you actually read it, I already stated I had updated to latest app, and I called customer service. zero stars",2025-05-10,2
No legitimate reason to require location permission. App auto-exits if you refuse location permissions.,2025-05-09,2

trash customer service. Offer Zelle through the app then when you finally have to use it they trigger a fraud and tell you try again in 48hrs,2025-04-09,2
The amount of permissions this app requires is a serious invasion of privacy. They want a list of all your apps along with your complete search history. An app to a bank to make payments on a loan does not need all of that information.,2025-04-07,2
They want too much access to your phone.,2025-04-01,2

I hate M&T with a passion and cannot wait for the day that I have time to kill my account with them. Monumental waste of time and energy to work with this garbage company.

why does this app need to have permission to manage and make phone calls from my phone and have to know my location in order for me to have access to use the app. not cool or appropriate for a user. needs to change that immediately.,2025-03-20,2

Would not proceed to letting me log in without allowing permissions to make and manage phone calls. Not necessary for a banking app. 1 star,2025-02-07,2
So incredibly invasive an app I didn't even contemplate using it. Read the permissions request and immediately deleted it. There is absolutely *****Zero***** reason for my bank to ask me for a list of installed apps on my phone.,2025-01-29,2
It won't open dependibly. Only works after several attempts. If it all. Aggravating!!!,2025-01-24,2
BS app doesn't need to know what all apps are on my phone.. give account info and that's it.. it doesn't need information on my phone about what apps I have and exc..,2025-01-22,2

"Mobile app would glitch and reset every time I tried to deposit a small check. I uninstalled and went to reinstall just to see that they collect all of your personal information, your location data, as well as information about every single app you have downloaded on your phone if you choose to use their app. Seems extremely intrusive and not a valid way to identify your customers.",2024-11-26,2

It's 2024 & u guys supposedly had reputation of being super high tech. WTH. What is so hard. I had banks that did this over a decade ago. People have been complaining a while.

Too many issues in this app make it unusable and this isn't about the version of the app. The issues are consistent even on the most recent update. The Zelle feature in your app is one of the most unstable features and fails to load. Log On is an issue as well. Please take accountability and do better.,2024-11-19,2
Horrible app. I can't log in even with 8 tries from this app. The app has multiple hidden permissions that are hard to un- permission the rest of them. Switch accounts is also a pain.

"Between all the banks I use, Chase, ESL and even a smaller FCU, this by far is the least optimized app. The fact the app directs you to a web browser for transactions or account functions instead of just using the app itself is a bit inexcusable in 2024. A user should be able to complete all, or at the very least most functions of a banking app within the app without being redirected. You have the funds to develop a stellar app, just seems like corporate greed/laziness truly.",2024-11-02,2

Tired of 2 step verify even though it is NOT turned on.... this bank is HORRIBLE. HOLDS USINESS CHECKS FOR A WEEK. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME USING THIS BANK. I had to File grievances with the state comptroller and attorney general. These acts are 100% ILLEGAL. DO NOT USE M&T!!!!!!,2024-11-01,2

Now I can go into the bank and cash it for no fee and deposit that cash on the spot for immediate availability. So why is it the app has to charge me $18.50 to do this? The larger the check, the more they charge. Profiting on us",2024-10-25,2
"Update: my apps are set to automatically update overnight. Having the latest version shouldn't be an issue. This app required locations services to be active every single time simply to log in. It also requires several other things beyond any other bank or credit card app. Not only did this app get deleted, closing my accounts with m&t is my top priority. They are far too invasive.",2024-10-23,2
Still haven't been able to open the app or login to my online banking. It's been 6 months. The bankers can't help me. The customer service support can't help me. Looking at different banks.

"Couldn't even begin to use the app because I'm not allowing ALL permissions-why is permission for my camera, contacts, to make phone calls needed??

I have to message you here because customer service can't be contacted. Pathetic. I would never recommend this bank.",2024-09-09,2

This is the worst mobile bank app ever. I'm going on 2 months using this bank app. First I need to identify myself by 1 finger print. 2 security questions. 3 send code. And enter it just to check my balance. I understand security. But this is to much of a pain. And getting your direct deposit 2 day's early. Not once in 8 pay week's. I totally recommend not using this bank I'm leaving.... -1 star,2024-07-30,2

The app itself seems good. The bank is the problem. Does'nt keep acurate amount. You will see one thing than next day is completely different. And it messes up your account. I zelled money to cover my mortgage payment because there wasn't enough. I did this before the mortgage payment went through last night. Get on today it was returned.

"Why is the mobile app always unavailable! Wasn't going to even mention how usually the first time I open the app in some time, the app freezes and I have to close and open the app again.

"Please fix your app. It is constantly crashing, not signing in properly when signed out automatically and say that ""mobile banking is temporarily unavailable"" and I have to force close the app and then reopen it.

It gives me the feeling that the app may not longer be secure to use.",2024-04-15,2
"Used to work smoothly and efficiently, but the past month or so it refuses to login. It just sends me through a loop of ""You were logged out due to inactivity.""

Nice when it works. Very recently ran into trouble which makes the app unusable. A pop-up crashes the app. Upon xing out of the pop-up I can view my funds for a split second before the app itself completely crashes . If that's fixed then would be usable again,2024-04-14,2

Opening the app and logging in it says you have been logged out due to inactivity even though I was logged out from last use. Then I get logged in and the option to unlock my card is not there. Have to log out and back in again to unlock my card. Sometimes takes more than once to achieve this. Somebody broke something and it's a real pain to use. And yes I have uninstalled and reinstalled with no change.,2024-04-13,2

"This app is CONSTANTLY down for maintenance. It's basically every single day. Today, I went to transfer money to eat lunch, and I'm unfortunately writing this review instead. If you use mobile banking on the regular bank with someone else.",2025-01-15,3
Used to be a good app. Not so much anymore offline more than it's online. Temporarily unavailable,2025-01-15,3

"Mobile banking and banking has gone down hill, M&T started good but now I'm looking to go to a credit union, electronic deposits are slow as a few days to go through, my wife has 802 and we get paid by the same place she gets her deposits several days before me. So I'm switching. Sorry M&T but you are making money off our pay by withholding our money for days and that's wrong.",2025-01-02,3
"The app hardly ever works, I rarely make it to the login screen.",2024-12-31,3
"After the last update, logs in sometimes, but usually just crashes. Repeatedly tried deleting cache, uninstalling then reinstalling, no change. Like we need another reason to dump M&T Bank, possibly the worst bank in the US! Running Android 12.",2024-12-31,3
It doesn't work more than it does,2024-12-21,3
Never loads even opened.,2024-12-21,3

"Frustrating to say the least. Like other comments it's useless. In my case I can't even sign in! Keeps telling me my ID and/or Passcode is incorrect. But it's NOT! Works perfectly on website.... Tried reset, reinstall, etc.. nothing works. Support no help. No one can tell me if problem is App, router settings, my Carriers settings, or something else....

Awful bank and app,2024-12-17,3
"This is the worst bank, always a problem to login in the app, paychecks deposit by 8am in the morning, other banks shows the balance immediately your employer pays you. Always a problem with zelle.",2024-12-17,3
"Will not load or let me check my bank account, the bank itself has been depositing my pay checks later and later the app and the bank both aren't worth the headache, bad banks like this one are the reason online banks are so much better",2024-12-15,3
Slow or no logon. Access is Temporary unavailable quite often,2024-12-14,3
Constantly unavailable.... why even have an app?,2024-12-13,3
It a horrible Ape I'm unable to long in to my bank account I have called the bank and they can't help me I don't even know my balance it's a horrible ape I want to change banks because I can't budget my money if I don't know my balance,2024-12-13,3
Absolutely the worst banking app I've ever used.,2024-12-11,3
Never opens when needed,2024-12-10,3
Why do you need phone management and location management?,2024-12-09,3

"In 2024, it is unacceptable to have a bank account that is completely inaccessible via mobile app. I deleted the app multiple times & reinstalled it.

I would like to know what kind of finacial experience consumers have had with this bank. Just curious?,2024-11-30,3
Worst experience I ever had including security breaches theft stalking identity theft and harassment of not to mention terrorism and migrant criminal activity and also cyber security and safety of your life. Putting you in danger of kidnapping rape and family child protection.death disease and war,2024-11-27,3
"Mobile app would glitch and reset every time I tried to deposit a small check. I uninstalled and went to reinstall just to see that they collect all of your personal information, your location data, as well as information about every single app you have downloaded on your phone if you choose to use their app. Seems extremely intrusive and not a valid way to identify your customers.",2024-11-26,3
Doesn't work half the time,2024-11-25,3
"Giving the app 1 rating until few things fixed (1) ATM needs to have ability to get your BALANCE in the same single transition w/ either deposit/withdrawal, like when u go to the teller. It's 2024 & u guys supposedly had reputation of being super high tech. WTH. What is so hard. I had banks that did this over a decade ago. People have been complaining a while. (2) Stop closing banks in Stop&Shop. If you're going to close the banks, expand the hours of reg branches. Leave/open ATM In the absence",2024-11-20,3
"Back again. Yall finally got the logging in fixed, but now whenever I try to deposit a check your app doesn't register dark backgrounds. It keeps saying use a dark background while I try it on my black microwave, leather jacket, my black dishwasher. I turn the lights on and off. Just need to fix the app. I'm not calling or emailing.",2024-11-19,3
Too many issues in this app make it unusable and this isn't about the version of the app. The issues are consistent even on the most recent update. The Zelle feature in your app is one of the most unstable features and fails to load. Log On is an issue as well. Please take accountability and do better.,2024-11-19,3
Horrible app. I can't log in even with 8 tries from this app. The app has multiple hidden permissions that are hard to un- permission the rest of them. Switch accounts is also a pain. Over bad UI and the UX team should understand how modern and more updated color schemes help people nav through the menu. Please help me to gain back access to my account and money that is missing.,2024-11-13,3
Money Smart error message in online and mobile banking and app 11/11/24. Not able to view or edit money smart content. Very upset. No answer at support number for holiday.,2024-11-12,3
Terrible App. Too intrusive Why does any app need a list of apps installed on my phone. This app should be banned by Google. I'm going to take my friends' advice and close my account at M&T bank.,2024-11-08,3

"Where is the ability to download ststements.. Wouldnt it been more expedient with Your reply of ""contact for Assistance"" to just reply with the actual answer?",2024-11-07,3
Banks do not need to know your location or have access to you calls in order to function properly.,2024-11-04,3
"It doesn't work more often than it does... For it being something that you NEED to manage your money, it's pretty upsetting that this has been like this for years and yet they have yet to fix it even though you can see the countless number of complaints on here and many more in sure made via phone call",2024-11-03,3
"Between all the banks I use, Chase, ESL and even a smaller FCU, this by far is the least optimized app. The fact the app directs you to a web browser for transactions or account functions instead of just using the app itself is a bit inexcusable in 2024. A user should be able to complete all, or at the very least most functions of a banking app within the app without being redirected. You have the funds to develop a stellar app, just seems like corporate greed/laziness truly.",2024-11-02,3
Everytime I go to use this app it won't open. I reinstalling to make it work. You get -10 if I could,2024-11-02,3
Tired of 2 step verify even though it is NOT turned on.... this bank is HORRIBLE. HOLDS USINESS CHECKS FOR A WEEK. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME USING THIS BANK. I had to File grievances with the state comptroller and attorney general. These acts are 100% ILLEGAL. DO NOT USE M&T!!!!!!,2024-11-01,3
"It keeps reversing all my payments without notifying me, leaving me to find out the next bill cycle. I don't want this negatively affecting my credit score, I'd rather know within 24 hours so I can fix it quickly and stay on top of things.",2024-10-28,3
Too invasive requires too many permissions I can't use the app without location services enabled now? Screw it just using browser from now on.,2024-10-27,3
"I've been an m&t customer for 15 years now. I always deposit my checks via Mobile bank so I can keep my check as a pay stub record. From time to time I do need need immediate availability for my money with today's tough economy so I can get bills paid before the weekend. Now I can go into the bank and cash it for no fee and deposit that cash on the spot for immediate availability. So why is it the app has to charge me $18.50 to do this? The larger the check, the more they charge. Profiting on us",2024-10-25,3
"Update: my apps are set to automatically update overnight. Having the latest version shouldn't be an issue. This app required locations services to be active every single time simply to log in. It also requires several other things beyond any other bank or credit card app. Not only did this app get deleted, closing my accounts with m&t is my top priority. They are far too invasive.",2024-10-23,3
Still haven't been able to open the app or login to my online banking. It's been 6 months. The bankers can't help me. The customer service support can't help me. Looking at different banks. I can't even get on Zelle because they are linked with M&T and just tell me to log into my m&t account. 👍,2024-10-22,3
"This app really sucks. Because of it, I am going to refinance my vehicle with another bank. It's ridiculous!",2024-10-21,3
It's probably the worst fraud dept. Of any bank. I hear Northwest doesn't have such a failed fraud policy. I get declined at an atm I frequent every week because they think it's fraud. I've called about this issue and was assured it wouldn't happen again. But it has many times.,2024-10-15,3
Too hard to see. Can't navigate easily to see transactions. Forced to use Zelle through the app and it's not as good.,2024-10-12,3

"Requires access to call logs, list of installed apps, and location awareness. No thanks.",2024-10-02,3
"App works like 35 percent of the time. There's literally no reason a major bank should have an app that crashes or is down this much. I'm thinking of changing my bank solely for that reason. It's down that much. Edit: it was updated it just didn't work, get off my review.",2024-10-01,3
"Couldn't even begin to use the app because I'm not allowing ALL permissions-why is permission for my camera, contacts, to make phone calls needed?? Location (not really) and notifications were all the permissions that are needed. Just uninstalled the app. Will stick to the online platform and just pay bills through my own bank's bill pay.",2024-09-26,3
App crashes while trying to access account. Do not have this problem with my other bank apps! Useless app.,2024-09-25,3
"App won't open. Just sits at splash screen. Also from previous use, this app asks for too many permissions. There's no reason location should be needed for this type of app unless looking for nearby ATMs. Storage should not be needed either unless you're storing or reading data from the phone. Contacts should not be needed either. Your mobile website does not work either. Impossible to log in. Keep getting an error about wrong passcode or username. Works on desktop tho",2024-09-25,3
"App is broken. For whatever reason, my fingerprint login isn't working. My password was a long, confusing mess, so I'm trying to reset it. That doesn't work. Clicking - forgot password - just sends me back to the home screen. Really instills confidence in a bank when their app doesn't even work.",2024-09-23,3
doesn't work.. very upsetting,2024-09-21,3
Why do you need to control my phone calls? I'll stick to walking into the branch.,2024-09-17,3

True trash. Wish I could finding the owners of this company just to spit in there faces,2024-09-10,3
"This is the worst bank I have ever dealt with in regard to customer service. Every phone call is 2 hours waiting. I downloaded the app to avoid this, and now I can't even adjust the payment on file without calling. It should never be a concern if I can remove a payment method from my own account. I have to message you here because customer service can't be contacted. Pathetic. I would never recommend this bank.",2024-09-09,3
This app should not require location and phone permissions. Just use normal 2fa like everyone else. This forced me to uninstall and seriously consider switching banks. Previous history with this app has also been terrible.,2024-09-08,3

Horrible the app is constantly down please do better. We give you allot of our money,2024-09-07,3
"If I could I would rate 0 stars The bank itself is terrible. I have my funds available less than half of the time after depositing my check. As for the app, I literally have to reset my password anytime I try to log in and then it tries to redirect me to chrome where it says it's the incorrect password. The bank also does not put temporary holds back into your account and if you get paid twice in one week they take payments from both checks for one purchase and lie when you dispute it",2024-09-07,3
App keeps crashing when I try to enroll.,2024-09-06,3

"Just reinstalled the app on my new phone. Will not allow me to change my passcode, just puts me back to the login screen no matter what how many times I hit the reset button. My phone had me clear the cache for the app as it came up saying the app is bugged.",2024-09-04,3

Update - The canned reply from m&t to my review is worse than no reply at all. if you actually read it, I already stated I had updated to latest app, and I called customer service. zero stars",2025-05-10,4

The amount of permissions this app requires is a serious invasion of privacy. They want a list of all your apps along with your complete search history. An app to a bank to make payments on a loan does not need all of that information.,2025-04-07,4
They want too much access to your phone.,2025-04-01,4

dysfunctional garbage app. flags everything you try to do as fraud and offers no 2 factor authentication to bypass. how on God's green Earth are there still banks that don't have the faintest idea of how to handle security?

So incredibly invasive an app I didn't even contemplate using it. Read the permissions request and immediately deleted it. There is absolutely *****Zero***** reason for my bank to ask me for a list of installed apps on my phone.,2025-01-29,4
It won't open dependibly. Only works after several attempts. If it all. Aggravating!!!,2025-01-24,4

Would not proceed to letting me log in without allowing permissions to make and manage phone calls. Not necessary for a banking app. 1 star,2025-02-07,5
So incredibly invasive an app I didn't even contemplate using it. Read the permissions request and immediately deleted it. There is absolutely *****Zero***** reason for my bank to ask me for a list of installed apps on my phone.,2025-01-29,5
It won't open dependibly. Only works after several attempts. If it all. Aggravating!!!,2025-01-24,5
BS app doesn't need to know what all apps are on my phone.. give account info and that's it.. it doesn't need information on my phone about what apps I have and exc..,2025-01-22,5
It would be great to not be asked to verify identity EVERY SINGLE TIME LOGGING IN... I have a fingerprint setup among other things to avoid that BS. Get with the times,2025-01-21,5
Just a overall bad app and bad bank,2025-01-21,5
Mobile deposits are no longer working. Forgot my fingerprint access. Update: my new question is: is this app ever working?!? Are you really sorry for the inconvenience because it doesn't seem so. Thinking it's time to find a new bank.,2025-01-16,5
Fix your app!!!!!,2025-01-16,5
Stopped working,2025-01-16,5
It's terrible 😤😤,2025-01-16,5

"The app keeps saying retry,please fix this problem.",2025-01-15,5
"This app is CONSTANTLY down for maintenance. It's basically every single day. Today, I went to transfer money to eat lunch, and I'm unfortunately writing this review instead. If you use mobile banking on the regular bank with someone else.",2025-01-15,5
Used to be a good app. Not so much anymore offline more than it's online. Temporarily unavailable,2025-01-15,5
Alway an unexpected error or mobile banking unavailable,2025-01-15,5
It requires permission to access and control phone calls. I don't need another app controlling my phone.,2025-01-15,5

"This app is constantly getting worked on, updated and down too much for it have no improvements if anything they're going backwards",2025-01-12,5
Worst bank app.,2025-01-09,5

"Mobile banking and banking has gone down hill, M&T started good but now I'm looking to go to a credit union, electronic deposits are slow as a few days to go through, my wife has 802 and we get paid by the same place she gets her deposits several days before me. So I'm switching. Sorry M&T but you are making money off our pay by withholding our money for days and that's wrong.",2025-01-02,5
"The app hardly ever works, I rarely make it to the login screen.",2024-12-31,5
"After the last update, logs in sometimes, but usually just crashes. Repeatedly tried deleting cache, uninstalling then reinstalling, no change. Like we need another reason to dump M&T Bank, possibly the worst bank in the US! Running Android 12.",2024-12-31,5
It doesn't work more than it does,2024-12-21,5
Never loads even opened.,2024-12-21,5
"Can't do anything unless you go into bank not useful in an emergency. 37 Been with this Bank since I was 18, will cancel my account and never use it again!!! Worst ever just like the rest. Stand together and hold these illegal entities responsible!!!",2024-12-21,5
"Frustrating to say the least. Like other comments it's useless. In my case I can't even sign in! Keeps telling me my ID and/or Passcode is incorrect. But it's NOT! Works perfectly on website.... Tried reset, reinstall, etc.. nothing works. Support no help. No one can tell me if problem is App, router settings, my Carriers settings, or something else.... It simply DOES NOT WORK ON MY PHONE (S24+)",2024-12-20,5
Hit or miss if it even let's you sign in,2024-12-17,5
"I don't understand how the app is never available in the morning when we need it. You had all night to do any updates! You make me sick, M&T! I will be leaving once I transfer my deposit to your company.",2024-12-17,5
Awful bank and app,2024-12-17,5
"This is the worst bank, always a problem to login in the app, paychecks deposit by 8am in the morning, other banks shows the balance immediately your employer pays you. Always a problem with zelle.",2024-12-17,5
"Will not load or let me check my bank account, the bank itself has been depositing my pay checks later and later the app and the bank both aren't worth the headache, bad banks like this one are the reason online banks are so much better",2024-12-15,5
Slow or no logon. Access is Temporary unavailable quite often,2024-12-14,5
Constantly unavailable.... why even have an app?,2024-12-13,5
It a horrible Ape I'm unable to long in to my bank account I have called the bank and they can't help me I don't even know my balance it's a horrible ape I want to change banks because I can't budget my money if I don't know my balance,2024-12-13,5
Absolutely the worst banking app I've ever used.,2024-12-11,5
Never opens when needed,2024-12-10,5
Why do you need phone management and location management?,2024-12-09,5

"In 2024, it is unacceptable to have a bank account that is completely inaccessible via mobile app. I deleted the app multiple times & reinstalled it.

To hard to use and allow,2024-12-03,5
Requires access to my entire phone and apps!,2024-12-02,5
App keeps locking me out asking me to reverify myself even after using my fingerprint and password,2024-12-01,5
I would like to know what kind of finacial experience consumers have had with this bank. Just curious?,2024-11-30,5
Worst experience I ever had including security breaches theft stalking identity theft and harassment of not to mention terrorism and migrant criminal activity and also cyber security and safety of your life. Putting you in danger of kidnapping rape and family child protection.death disease and war,2024-11-27,5
"Mobile app would glitch and reset every time I tried to deposit a small check. I uninstalled and went to reinstall just to see that they collect all of your personal information, your location data, as well as information about every single app you have downloaded on your phone if you choose to use their app. Seems extremely intrusive and not a valid way to identify your customers.",2024-11-26,5
Doesn't work half the time,2024-11-25,5
"Giving the app 1 rating until few things fixed (1) ATM needs to have ability to get your BALANCE in the same single transition w/ either deposit/withdrawal, like when u go to the teller. It's 2024 & u guys supposedly had reputation of being super high tech. WTH. What is so hard. I had banks that did this over a decade ago. People have been complaining a while. (2) Stop closing banks in Stop&Shop. If you're going to close the banks, expand the hours of reg branches. Leave/open ATM In the absence",2024-11-20,5
"Back again. Yall finally got the logging in fixed, but now whenever I try to deposit a check your app doesn't register dark backgrounds. It keeps saying use a dark background while I try it on my black microwave, leather jacket, my black dishwasher. I turn the lights on and off. Just need to fix the app. I'm not calling or emailing.",2024-11-19,5
Too many issues in this app make it unusable and this isn't about the version of the app. The issues are consistent even on the most recent update. The Zelle feature in your app is one of the most unstable features and fails to load. Log On is an issue as well. Please take accountability and do better.,2024-11-19,5
Horrible app. I can't log in even with 8 tries from this app. The app has multiple hidden permissions that are hard to un- permission the rest of them. Switch accounts is also a pain. Over bad UI and the UX team should understand how modern and more updated color schemes help people nav through the menu. Please help me to gain back access to my account and money that is missing.,2024-11-13,5
Money Smart error message in online and mobile banking and app 11/11/24. Not able to view or edit money smart content. Very upset. No answer at support number for holiday.,2024-11-12,5
Terrible App. Too intrusive Why does any app need a list of apps installed on my phone. This app should be banned by Google. I'm going to take my friends' advice and close my account at M&T bank.,2024-11-08,5
Having problems paying my car loan app is making me do something that I don't need to do,2024-11-07,5
"Where is the ability to download ststements.. Wouldnt it been more expedient with Your reply of ""contact for Assistance"" to just reply with the actual answer?",2024-11-07,5
Banks do not need to know your location or have access to you calls in order to function properly.,2024-11-04,5
"It doesn't work more often than it does... For it being something that you NEED to manage your money, it's pretty upsetting that this has been like this for years and yet they have yet to fix it even though you can see the countless number of complaints on here and many more in sure made via phone call",2024-11-03,5
"Between all the banks I use, Chase, ESL and even a smaller FCU, this by far is the least optimized app. The fact the app directs you to a web browser for transactions or account functions instead of just using the app itself is a bit inexcusable in 2024. A user should be able to complete all, or at the very least most functions of a banking app within the app without being redirected. You have the funds to develop a stellar app, just seems like corporate greed/laziness truly.",2024-11-02,5
Everytime I go to use this app it won't open. I reinstalling to make it work. You get -10 if I could,2024-11-02,5
Tired of 2 step verify even though it is NOT turned on.... this bank is HORRIBLE. HOLDS USINESS CHECKS FOR A WEEK. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME USING THIS BANK. I had to File grievances with the state comptroller and attorney general. These acts are 100% ILLEGAL. DO NOT USE M&T!!!!!!,2024-11-01,5
"It keeps reversing all my payments without notifying me, leaving me to find out the next bill cycle. I don't want this negatively affecting my credit score, I'd rather know within 24 hours so I can fix it quickly and stay on top of things.",2024-10-28,5
Too invasive requires too many permissions I can't use the app without location services enabled now? Screw it just using browser from now on.,2024-10-27,5
"I've been an m&t customer for 15 years now. I always deposit my checks via Mobile bank so I can keep my check as a pay stub record. From time to time I do need need immediate availability for my money with today's tough economy so I can get bills paid before the weekend. Now I can go into the bank and cash it for no fee and deposit that cash on the spot for immediate availability. So why is it the app has to charge me $18.50 to do this? The larger the check, the more they charge. Profiting on us",2024-10-25,5
"Update: my apps are set to automatically update overnight. Having the latest version shouldn't be an issue. This app required locations services to be active every single time simply to log in. It also requires several other things beyond any other bank or credit card app. Not only did this app get deleted, closing my accounts with m&t is my top priority. They are far too invasive.",2024-10-23,5
Still haven't been able to open the app or login to my online banking. It's been 6 months. The bankers can't help me. The customer service support can't help me. Looking at different banks. I can't even get on Zelle because they are linked with M&T and just tell me to log into my m&t account. 👍,2024-10-22,5
"This app really sucks. Because of it, I am going to refinance my vehicle with another bank. It's ridiculous!",2024-10-21,5
It's probably the worst fraud dept. Of any bank. I hear Northwest doesn't have such a failed fraud policy. I get declined at an atm I frequent every week because they think it's fraud. I've called about this issue and was assured it wouldn't happen again. But it has many times.,2024-10-15,5
Too hard to see. Can't navigate easily to see transactions. Forced to use Zelle through the app and it's not as good.,2024-10-12,5

"Requires access to call logs, list of installed apps, and location awareness. No thanks.",2024-10-02,5
"App works like 35 percent of the time. There's literally no reason a major bank should have an app that crashes or is down this much. I'm thinking of changing my bank solely for that reason. It's down that much. Edit: it was updated it just didn't work, get off my review.",2024-10-01,5
"Couldn't even begin to use the app because I'm not allowing ALL permissions-why is permission for my camera, contacts, to make phone calls needed?? Location (not really) and notifications were all the permissions that are needed. Just uninstalled the app. Will stick to the online platform and just pay bills through my own bank's bill pay.",2024-09-26,5
App crashes while trying to access account. Do not have this problem with my other bank apps! Useless app.,2024-09-25,5
"App won't open. Just sits at splash screen. Also from previous use, this app asks for too many permissions. There's no reason location should be needed for this type of app unless looking for nearby ATMs. Storage should not be needed either unless you're storing or reading data from the phone. Contacts should not be needed either. Your mobile website does not work either. Impossible to log in. Keep getting an error about wrong passcode or username. Works on desktop tho",2024-09-25,5
"App is broken. For whatever reason, my fingerprint login isn't working. My password was a long, confusing mess, so I'm trying to reset it. That doesn't work. Clicking - forgot password - just sends me back to the home screen. Really instills confidence in a bank when their app doesn't even work.",2024-09-23,5
doesn't work.. very upsetting,2024-09-21,5
Why do you need to control my phone calls? I'll stick to walking into the branch.,2024-09-17,5

True trash. Wish I could finding the owners of this company just to spit in there faces,2024-09-10,5
"This is the worst bank I have ever dealt with in regard to customer service. Every phone call is 2 hours waiting. I downloaded the app to avoid this, and now I can't even adjust the payment on file without calling. It should never be a concern if I can remove a payment method from my own account. I have to message you here because customer service can't be contacted. Pathetic. I would never recommend this bank.",2024-09-09,5
This app should not require location and phone permissions. Just use normal 2fa like everyone else. This forced me to uninstall and seriously consider switching banks. Previous history with this app has also been terrible.,2024-09-08,5

"If I could I would rate 0 stars The bank itself is terrible. I have my funds available less than half of the time after depositing my check. As for the app, I literally have to reset my password anytime I try to log in and then it tries to redirect me to chrome where it says it's the incorrect password. The bank also does not put temporary holds back into your account and if you get paid twice in one week they take payments from both checks for one purchase and lie when you dispute it",2024-09-07,5

Has been a decent app until recently where it just keeps stopping & freezing where you need to exit the app & go back into it just for it to do the same thing over & over.,2024-04-16,5
"Please fix your app. It is constantly crashing, not signing in properly when signed out automatically and say that ""mobile banking is temporarily unavailable"" and I have to force close the app and then reopen it.

It gives me the feeling that the app may not longer be secure to use.",2024-04-15,5
"Used to work smoothly and efficiently, but the past month or so it refuses to login. It just sends me through a loop of ""You were logged out due to inactivity.""

Nice when it works. Very recently ran into trouble which makes the app unusable. A pop-up crashes the app. Upon xing out of the pop-up I can view my funds for a split second before the app itself completely crashes . If that's fixed then would be usable again,2024-04-14,5
"The app crashes all the time. I try to log in, and it goes to a screen that says I've been logged out for safety because the session expired - the session never even gets started before it just closes!

"For two weeks I've been experiencing the same issue many others have stared when I log in the app will close immediately before I even get to look at my accounts.

"About a week ago, this app started the habit of crashing immediately after I had entered my login information.",2024-04-13,5
This app last updated in Dec of 2023 but as of this month has started having severe issues. Opening the app and logging in it says you have been logged out due to inactivity even though I was logged out from last use. Then I get logged in and the option to unlock my card is not there. Have to log out and back in again to unlock my card. Sometimes takes more than once to achieve this. Somebody broke something and it's a real pain to use. And yes I have uninstalled and reinstalled with no change.,2024-04-13,5
"Used to be great until for the past week it keeps bouncing me out every time I open it due to ""inactivity"" even though it was swiped away previously so freshly opened not just a has been chilling in the background sitch.

I do so and often get the same message again. Additionally, I now also get a messase saying that the app constantly crashes and needs to be closed. Please fix ASAP.

Every time I try to log on using the fingerprint sensor I get a message to ""log in first with your userid and password to enroll your fingerprint."" I've ""enrolled"" my fingerprint umpteen times and yet I keep getting this message. It makes using the fingerprint login kind of silly....it adds extra steps to the process instead of making it easier.",2024-01-15,5
