no real service,2025-05-23,1

"App developers willfully told anyone with an Android 9 that Wells doesn't want our business. When the app worked on 9 it was awesome. Now I have no online banking. Not spending 4 to 800 bucks on a new phone for ""new features"" I'm not interested in.",2025-05-16,1

"I'm really disappointed that I wasn't able to Zelle or Transfer money without calling customer service. And then my account got restricted so I no longer have access.

Join the wimps at Chase.",2025-05-13,1
worst bank in history! After being approved for an active cash card and using it continuously with on time payments it was cancelled because supposedly I didn't give them my address information. I never received so much as a message to verify my information! p.s. the app is slow üëé,2025-05-13,1

"Just a terrible outdated banking application. The capital one banking app and chase banking app actually function when you have multiple accounts this app limits you to one account per user i guess ( been told you can do multiple but no one knows how) Just has simple basic functions needs to be updated and brought into the year 2025 very, very badly, virtually useless",2025-05-11,1

"since wells Fargo updated their mobile app it will no longer work with a lot of older android phone's, so either go out and buy a new phone or find a better Bank? I believe I'll go look for a better Bank",2025-05-09,1
Mobile deposit takes 10+ tries for success. Worst mobile deposit app I've ever used.,2025-05-09,1
"Unable to remove Zelle recipient. ""Delete"" button is not functional.",2025-05-09,1
App can longer read front of checks with latest update. doesn't matter if it's a printed check or written check. It can't read the front since the latest update. Making mobile deposits impossible. Reads the back with endorsement just fine. Edit: Even with today's update. Doesn't read front of checks. That's two updates in a row where front of checks can't be captured with mobile deposit. Back of check still works. Useless for mobile deposit as it is. Pixel 9 Pro XL.,2025-05-09,1
"Disappointed by Treatment During Financial Hardship I‚Äôve been a long-time customer of Wells Fargo, but I was deeply disappointed by how I was treated during a recent period of financial hardship. While my family and I were struggling for three months, the bank placed a week-long hold on my paycheck and closed my credit card account without warning. At a time when I needed support and flexibility the most, Wells Fargo failed to have my back. I expected more from an institution I‚Äôve trusted.",2025-05-09,1
security is so high that even call center team isn't able to override to do basic functions like transfers,2025-05-08,1

The worst bank I've ever encounteredüëéüèæ,2025-05-08,1
honestly I don't like it because people on the system acting like they care what each other makes with their own money. and always playing like they are hackers and no one don't know but unfortunately I know much more than they think. I know people are manipulating my phone and spying on me everyday 24/7 and put me on YouTube. Facebook.. Instagram.. ticktock.. I don't what they really want it. that's why I don't trust any bank ir many other companies if not in person I don't trust the system,2025-05-08,1

Don't do Bank to Bank transfer with Wells Fargo. Because they send you a response saying it will be in your account on a certain day. But they don't tell you until you call it has from 8am until 11:59 pm to be in the account. So it's better to take it out of the other bank account and put it in Wells Fargo account if you can. Or take it out of Wells Fargo account and put it into the other bank account if you can. Don't do Bank to Bank transfers.,2025-05-06,1
I can't even log in. The log in screen is so overlapped that it won't allow me to click the sign in button.,2025-05-06,1
"Wells Fargo is almost as bad as bank of america! Look up ""Fractal Banking"". 90% of any unpaid loan can be credited as a new loan, and then 90% of that loaned, and so on... It's fake/free money and they still have the audacity to charge banking fees for using your money to invest!? LMAO!",2025-05-06,1
i haven't gotten paid. i usually get paid at 3-4 pm on Tuesdays. it is currently 9p.m. do you know how bad this screwed me??????? been with this company almost a decade. im about to close my account. you are seriously messing with people's lives here...,2025-05-06,1

unable to use the app with my android that is ridiculous,2025-05-03,1
Latest update makes this app very difficult to use. 11 minutes to get code for two-step verification is inexcusable for a banking app.,2025-05-03,1
this app is terrible,2025-05-03,1
useless,2025-05-03,1
always hold my deposits to cause overdraft...,2025-05-01,1
don't sign up when they offer you a $200 promotion. they move heaven and earth not to give it to you. all you have to do is spend a certain amount in a certain amount of days which I did in half the time. they investigate it to see if you have earned it and never call you back. also you can only make a certain amount of payments each month online.,2025-05-01,1
trying to open up a checking account,2025-05-01,1

"There is nothing special about this bank. To be honest, their fees are the same as every other bank, and customer support is equally as underwhelming. In my opinion, if you are thinking of swapping banks I would not go to Wells Fargo it will just be more of the same.",2025-04-30,1

"The old app was awesome. I was forced to download the new app and it never loads. I've tried a number of times and get a message saying it will be added to my phone soon and nothing ever happens. So frustrating and really inconvenient. I can't do any mobile banking from my phone.

"I started with this bank as a kids account and at this point I only use it to pay bills. But I am moving away from that. Charging me $10 a month for not using this account is a little silly and outdated I feel that way for any bank but what do you expect from a bank that has so many scandals. Thankfully I can Navy federal credit union, not everyone has different options but wells fargo probably isn't the best",2025-04-29,1

cant use the app with my phone and I work during bank hours so cant deposit my check with a teller. Do not currently have my debit card so cant deposit my check at the drive thru. At best its extremely inconvenient and is generally useless.,2025-04-27,1
I have talked with customer support about the purchase I made on Ali Express and it keeps denying the transaction because Wells Fargo thinks my card is hijacked and has to keep confirming its me and I keep saying yes its me and the transaction keeps failing. I cant even buy what I need Wells Fargo is locking my card when I have been nothing but confirming its me using it.,2025-04-27,1
No useful help at all.,2025-04-27,1
Just do what I ask. Nothing more than that.,2025-04-26,1
"The changing of your app is not the fault of our phones. it is because Wells Fargo doesn't care about its long lasting customers. Your app excluded many older phones. Unfortunately due to not being able to deposit checks through my phone app. as well as I will now have to be going to a branch, I will be forced to leave Wells Fargo after more than 45 years.",2025-04-26,1

Completely useless app!!! Don't waste your time with it!,2025-04-19,1
So freaking sick of this app. It invalidates the password ALL THE TIME. The password that I KNOW is right and makes me change it. And of course the password rules are idiotic in not letting me reuse the pw (that I know works). I hate this bank. I hate this app. I have 4 other bank apps that do NOT do this. But then again they don't charge me fees like WF either. Can not wait to switch my buisness away from these vultures.,2025-04-19,1
No reason to download the app for most people. Only reason you would need it is to deposit checks by phone. App makes me MFA every single log in and is slow. It doesn't do anything for me the mobile website doesn't do.,2025-04-19,1
Zelle isn't working??,2025-04-18,1
No longer compatible with my device. This is a huge disappointment as the phone is not that old and was a flagship model. I do not want to have to purchase a new one just so I can use my banking app when this one works perfectly fine. Looks like I'm going to go with my local CU as their app IS still compatible. I've been a loyal customer for most of my adult life. Your dev's should really consider ALL of your customer base. It is not that hard to include older operating systems. Do better!,2025-04-18,1

Don't do Bank to Bank transfer with Wells Fargo. Because they send you a response saying it will be in your account on a certain day.

why is that sometimes it will count pending charge in your overall balance and sometimes it doesn't. it should be one or the other cause when I do the math after everything it feels like wells Fargo has designed an app to fugde the numbers somewhat. other apps can show me the true amount just fine every time why can't wells fargo. it's not clarification that's needed its why the decision was made to have the literal calculator not show all totals. i have left this in the feedback multiple times,2025-03-18,2

So freaking sick of this app. It invalidates the password ALL THE TIME. The password that I KNOW is right and makes me change it. And of course the password rules are idiotic in not letting me reuse the pw (that I know works). I hate this bank. I hate this app. I have 4 other bank apps that do NOT do this. But then again they don't charge me fees like WF either. Can not wait to switch my buisness away from these vultures.,2025-04-19,3

why is that sometimes it will count pending charge in your overall balance and sometimes it doesn't. it should be one or the other cause when I do the math after everything it feels like wells Fargo has designed an app to fugde the numbers somewhat. other apps can show me the true amount just fine every time why can't wells fargo. it's not clarification that's needed its why the decision was made to have the literal calculator not show all totals. i have left this in the feedback multiple times,2025-03-18,3
"You keep having trouble matching the check amount in the picture your app took to the amount I entered for my deposit.

Don't do Bank to Bank transfer with Wells Fargo. Because they send you a response saying it will be in your account on a certain day. But they don't tell you until you call it has from 8am until 11:59 pm to be in the account. So it's better to take it out of the other bank account and put it in Wells Fargo account if you can. Or take it out of Wells Fargo account and put it into the other bank account if you can. Don't do Bank to Bank transfers.,2025-05-06,4

why is that sometimes it will count pending charge in your overall balance and sometimes it doesn't. it should be one or the other cause when I do the math after everything it feels like wells Fargo has designed an app to fugde the numbers somewhat. other apps can show me the true amount just fine every time why can't wells fargo. it's not clarification that's needed its why the decision was made to have the literal calculator not show all totals. i have left this in the feedback multiple times,2025-03-18,4

Don't do Bank to Bank transfer with Wells Fargo. Because they send you a response saying it will be in your account on a certain day. But they don't tell you until you call it has from 8am until 11:59 pm to be in the account. So it's better to take it out of the other bank account and put it in Wells Fargo account if you can.

why is that sometimes it will count pending charge in your overall balance and sometimes it doesn't. it should be one or the other cause when I do the math after everything it feels like wells Fargo has designed an app to fugde the numbers somewhat. other apps can show me the true amount just fine every time why can't wells fargo. it's not clarification that's needed its why the decision was made to have the literal calculator not show all totals. i have left this in the feedback multiple times,2025-03-18,5
