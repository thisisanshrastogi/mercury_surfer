Terrible next business day transfer policy. What was supposed to be 1 business day for a ACH transfer took 3. This is not a new account. They used to have next business day transfers and it nakes a difference on whether I cam pay stuff on time. AVOID if you can,2025-05-24,1
"This is the worst app ever for a financial institution. I regularly cannot access my account or information through this PIECE OF ABSOLUTE GARBAGE. At current, the app freezes and allows me nowhere interaction with the home page. everything is unresponsive.",2025-05-24,1
"everything about this app is garbage. takes MORE than 7 days to transfer money. I have 12 grand in my account, and automatic payments set up to pay my car payment (a week earlier than the due date) pending... pending.... pending... canceled!!! now, for the first time in my life, I have a late payment, and it's going to damage my credit score. I will never use Ally again!!",2025-05-23,1

"for about the past week, app has been non-functional with interface freezing after login, won't scroll, won't respond to key presses. sent feedback and got not response. Pixel 9a received an app update and the problem persists.",2025-05-23,1
Do you plan on fixing your app? it hasn't worked for weeks now. can't scroll or select any options on the screen. junk app for a junk company.,2025-05-23,1
app unresponsive after login,2025-05-23,1
"As of 5/23/2025 the app only allows me to log in. Once the main screen loads, it freezes immediately. Cannot access any information or even log out. Since this is an online bank with no brick and mortar branches, it is imperative that the app is reliable. Otherwise, I am forced to close my accounts and change banks altogether.",2025-05-23,1

"Just like the actual bank, this app is garbage. It doesn't work when the sun goes down because ""reasons"". The app literally has bankers hours. I work nights and can never pay my truck payment because their app never works at night time. what a joke.",2025-05-22,1

"Why aren't there push notifications for debit card transactions? The app used to have it but it was removed so this is extremely frustrating there is not alternative. The ""withdrawal"" bank alert does NOT provide this information.",2025-05-20,1
"The worst decision I've ever made. During covid, I was 3 payments behind 1K ,& they repo-ed the car in 21. despite talking to them every day & paying them within 2 weeks, they still took the car far 200 miles away & tried to sell it out from under me. Forward to today 25, Tried to get a payoff quote, but they still have it in repo status. customer service says call ally repo, ally repo says call ally customer service, they refused to talk to each other. Can't wait to never deal with them again",2025-05-20,1

"even though I've made my auto payment.you don't see your receipt or resent activity when they already took your payment. not only that but when you call customer service and tell them what's going on they Will tell you exactly what's happening in your Auto account. this is headache.

still getting an error saying you can't take me to my investing account at this time,2025-05-12,1
"The worst banking app I have ever used. login page, account page and zelle almost always time out. The app shows under maintenance most times I open it. I doubt they even refresh the token, I have to close the app and relogin even in active session. Most of my time I am just staring at the screen loading. I am surprised how this is allowed in a banking app.",2025-05-11,1
"It is always down for maintenance, frustrating when you can't access your money.",2025-05-09,1
would like to access this app with my Galaxy Note 8 please,2025-05-09,1
"I started using Ally to boost my credit. To my surprise, they knocked 100 points OFF my credit score. This is what they do...when you make your payment on your credit card, they hold it for a good week. Then they deny the payment, send it back and report a late payment to the credit bureau! They did this 3 times in a row to me until I quit paying them all together. I don't understand their motive but I deeply regret getting a card with Ally. They target people working on their credit. Sad.",2025-05-08,1
"""we can't take you to your account right now. we're not sure why"": the message that greets me every time! why have you messed up the charts for stocks? Now the maximum is 1 Year. And the daily % change isn't seen any more. Won't let you use your VPN, no explanation. Sometimes stock shares disappear and then reappear in a day or two, makes tracking assets difficult. Still has an ancient account I closed years ago in the list. and why does it make you confirm just to go back to the snapshot?",2025-05-07,1
App is still horrible. Unacceptable for a bank to have a unstable app. Always one issue after another with this app. Now it constantly crashes when trying to transfer funds.,2025-05-07,1
"Recently, I cannot access my account. It will not connect. Also, when I'm able, they've added silly spending buckets, which were the default for you account view. May 6, 2025: After a year or of the app working, it has again stopped. It freezes or won't open at all. If it does, it can't access my account ""at this time."" Fingerprint sign in won't work at all.",2025-05-07,1
"I have so many frustrations and zero hope that they will fix them (do not respond with your stupid 'contact us' template), but they have nice enough phone agents to earn one more star than the minimum. Edit: If I have to set up biometric log-in ONE MORE TIME, I'm going to cancel my damn accounts. Why do I have to link my bank account to my savings separately when my credit card has been linked for years? This is so stupid. I regret doing business with this company so much.",2025-05-06,1
I don't want to see ads on my snapshot screen.,2025-05-06,1
do not use this bank or get loan from this bank! worst of worst,2025-05-05,1
I have been unable to open this app. I've tried uninstalling & reinstalling the app to no avail. I've called Ally for assistance & the rep couldn't help me & finally told me to call back another day.,2025-05-05,1
"Bank and Invest are always broken in some way, usually keeping me from making important and timely financial decisions.",2025-05-05,1
I have been unable to log in to either the app or the online web page since changing my phone number. I realize that it's a simple fix to update the secondary verification but I have been unable to get anyone at Ally customer service to accomplish this. I have sat on the phone with them for over 3 hours during 5 phone calls in 5 months and still nothing but me being transferred repeatedly. I enjoyed Ally servicing prior to this but this experience is making me question this decision.,2025-05-04,1
I hate the customer service for this company. You're here to help? And then you can't help? The least helpful and customer friendly app and company edit: tell me WHY your password reset security code is so damn slow? here i am WAITING to get a security code and move on with my life but they literally come in too late and then the one I use is incorrect. took way too long just for yall to take my money. make your app more user friendly and accessible and fast. and no I don't want to call anyone,2025-05-04,1
"This app takes FOREVER to load and gives errors a lot. This is not acceptable especially while I'm at the store trying to unlock my card to make a purchase and people are waiting behind me. ALLY, I ASK THAT YOU PLEASE FIX THIS. Thank You.",2025-05-03,1
"using this for a small car payment. Was fine in the first month (currently on month 5), but my gripe is that I can no longer see my payment progress, nor can I see previous history of payments. whenever I click these functions, it crashes or it tells me it cannot complete this function. uninstall/reinstall twice without success. I've called CS (India) as well as email in my issues, but like others have said, it's fallen on deaf ears. will be leaving ASAP.",2025-05-03,1
Newest update does not allow me to view my transaction history in the app,2025-05-02,1
"Too many annoying bugs. Zelle history doesn't display, account history doesn't display, and half the time finger print login doesn't work which forces me to restart the app. I also don't need to see an unnecessary animation each time I start the app, I just want to see my accounts. They also forcing a Zelle QR code splash screen EVERY single time even after I've declined it every single time. It's ridiculous. Do the engineers test this stuff before release?",2025-05-02,1
"Love the bank, hate the app. It frequently fails to load transactions. Distributing funds in my buckets often blocks out moving money from my unbucketed area even when there is money there to transfer. I have to login in my computer to distribute often. The app often also fails to load my recent transactions.",2025-05-02,1
"Earlier this week, I had issues logging in. Then today, there are more login issues. After many tries of closing and opening the app, I was able to log in. Then I find out Zelle doesn't work.",2025-05-02,1
"This is the glitchiest app ever. It is constantly saying that my banking information is unavailable, and ""they are working on it."" I'm sorry, but this isn't some game, this is my money that I use to run my business! It is a little scary when both the app and the online website are down and I can't access my banking info. Do better! I wish I would have used Relay bank instead of Ally. If this keeps happening I might switch to Relay.",2025-05-02,1
"suddenly you can't make transfers in the app?? what's the point then? and the website will not log you in until you receive a text. I do not have phone service where I am, why can you not just send an email?? can't do a single thing.",2025-05-02,1
"Cannot login via app or laptop across 3 different browsers. App is broken AGAIN after latest update. Endless issues with the website and the app: freezes, timeouts, error messages, etc., and every update brings new problems. I transferred the bulk of my money to a different bank a few months ago when the issues impacted a down payment wire transfer... never trust Ally as your main bank because they WILL fail and you won't be able to access your accounts when you need them in a hurry.",2025-05-01,1
"Ally has some strange policies that cause unnecessary problems. I recently had fraud on my credit card, but instead of just giving me a new card number, they closed the entire account and opened a new one. This negatively affected my credit score in a way that will take a long time to recover from... for no good reason! The only good thing about Ally is their ""buckets"" feature for savings accounts.",2025-05-01,1
Ally has apparently activated Zelle in my account and apparently is having a great deal of difficulty in revoking its unauthorized action.,2025-04-28,1
Please fix your app never been late on a payment and dont want to start now called as requested still say I have a auto code and password I haven't had a vehicle with ally in 5 years and you want me to remember a cars info from 5 years ago I just want to pay my cc there is nothing to link and called different departments and the send you to someone else pointless,2025-04-26,1
App hasn't worked in months. Kind of a big deal if you're an online-only bank.,2025-04-25,1
Latest update makes you go through an ad/marketing splash menu before logging in. I've already downloaded the app... Why are you advertising to people that are already customers? Very annoying.,2025-04-24,1
8 days to cash a check in 2025 is ridiculous. I am absolutely switching to a different bank over this.,2025-04-23,1
"been using for years and it is getting absolutely insane. you cannot use a VPN to protect your own data when you log in. if your biometrics doesnt catch the VERY FIRST try, you have to completely close the app and again... and again... and too many tries actually locks you out of the entire account. after (if) you log in, they delay a ""notification"" just long enough so that your thumb is over the spam instead of where you actually wanted to tap.",2025-04-22,1
RUN FROM THIS BANK IM WARNING YOU THEY ARE TERRIBLE!!!! I HAD MY BANK HERE FOR 8 YEARS AND THEY CLOSED MY ACCOUNTS WITH NO WARNING AND WONT GIVE ME MY MONEY BACK!! ITS BEEN 14 DAYS!!!,2025-04-21,1
"The credentials that will log me in to the Web site and the old version of the app do not work on this new version. I just tried again. I logged on to Chrome no problem. This app still says my credentials are wrong. It's not me it's not my credentials it's this app. Still 1 star. and again the app, using credentials I just used to sign on to the web site, still says I have the wind credentials and wants me to change my password. The UN & PW are fine in the website. Zero stars app totally useless",2025-04-20,1
"the app really sucks. when it's works it's fine, but I have to uninstall and reinstall it usually twice a week, sometimes more, due to a random bug where it just says ""our system is unavailable."" if I don't reinstall it will just say that for days at a time and I can't use the app at all.",2025-04-18,1
Terrible app. Never works. I don't have the time to call which is what it always tells me to do. why have an app if it doesn't work?,2025-04-17,1
"terrible loan service, I'm signed for auto pay and takes 2-3 days to process.",2025-04-17,1
Can't even set up anything. Put in the date of birth and social and it says something's not right. I have never had an account with them,2025-04-17,1
"Complete garbage. It's so buggy, it will remove your auto payment and hurt your credit. If you want your credit destroyed, use ally. Think I'm just a random angry customer? Check their social media. a class action lawsuit is about to hit them in the face for this. i spoke to customer service already. you don't threaten your customers credit and get away with it. so I'm not changing my review. if you can permanently affect me with my credit. I'll do the same with this review",2025-04-15,1
have had to call multiple times for issues,2025-04-15,1

horrible,2025-04-06,1
I just tried to mobile deposit a 5 times check. But it keeps giving me the error of check needs to be flat and all corners visible. Whoever updated this app is an idiot and needs to be fired. The just made this app useless to me.,2025-04-04,1
"ever since the update the app crashes, unenrolls my biometrics, has an error message at login. one of the worse downgrade I've ever experienced with an app. I'm considering switching banks because of this app",2025-04-04,1
I haven't been able to log in my account for 3 weeks. I call ally and I get a call center overseas and I cannot understand there language all I want to do is access my account and cannot get past login page UPDATE. I responded to the response on this review by Ally and it's now been 9 days with no response. Still couldn't understand person when I call because they barely speak English. Worst Customer service I've ever seen,2025-04-04,1
they try to make a payment for a week and not working,2025-04-04,1
"The app is clunky, difficult to navigate, slow, and Zelle is just the worst! I would recommend other online banking before Ally.",2025-04-03,1
"The app was great when we first got our loan. Within the last 3 months, I haven't been able to make payments on the app or online. I've messaged with customer service on the app, and it falls on deaf ears constantly. They give you a number to call, and 30 minutes later, you might have someone to talk to, but they quickly transfer you, and you are waiting again. Very disappointed with the whole Ally experience",2025-04-03,1
I can't set up to pay my payment I've been trying 4 weeks. I have taked to Reps none of them have fixed the problem.,2025-04-02,1
Great bank garbage app,2025-04-02,1
I was not able to make any zelle transfers from my checking And there was no option in the app to change it. and chat couldn't help me,2025-04-02,1
This app barely works if you have a VPN active. More often than not I can't sign in at all unless I disconnect from it and I'm unwilling to sacrifice privacy for their policies.,2025-04-01,1
somehow every single time I open this app it's down and I am unable to make a payment. it's crazy.,2025-04-01,1
ever since I had this bank the app been horrendous. Always a glitch and my banking information is never loaded or the app never loads. Right now my account cannot load the information due to a glitch. worse decision I made transferring to this bank,2025-03-31,1
app always crashing unreliable,2025-03-31,1
"Horrible app that never works, cheap debit cards with chips always malfunctioning. One day you'll find yourself in an emergency where you need the app to transfer money over and you're going to be screwed because of Ally Bank.",2025-03-31,1
"Ally bank App doesn't work today, I'm disappointed",2025-03-31,1
"Ally Bank locks you from accessing your money. The app is terrible at 'switching' the 'to' and 'from' accounts. you think you're sending it in one direction, and then you find out it's going in the other direction. This is the only financial institution app I have ever had such problems. Ally says they don't charge fees, which they don't, but they lock you out of accessing your money. What a terrible company. No one at the call centers are able to answer these questions either.",2025-03-31,1
"Unable to deposit checks via the app - the image capture is not able to capture a satisfactory image no matter what. In addition, the app fails to load/log-in more than 75% of the time - you have to force-quit it to get it to work each time. These are bread-and-butter capabilities, and their lack is making me consider if I need a different institution that takes customer access platforms seriously, especially for an online- only financial institution.",2025-03-30,1
"it sucks, the company sucks. i want my extra payments to go toward principal, not my next payment",2025-03-30,1
never allows me to log in,2025-03-28,1
The app is constantly unavailable - it looks to be related to biometrics authentication. Whenever this happens I will annoyingly just login to the web app - but it took me forever to realize that the app is experiencing issues and not just Ally as a whole. PLEASE FIX THIS. [this is the 3rd update of this review],2025-03-28,1
"never works when you need it, and made me have one late payment on my credit.",2025-03-28,1
"For the second time, my spending buckets have disappeared from my checking account and no response from Ally as to how to fix it.",2025-03-27,1
Update: the app has been dog slow for the past few months and overall service of the bank has been degrading throughout the years. Ally is not the prime online bank it once was.,2025-03-27,1
"Do not trust this company with your money. Their off shore agents will lie to you, waste your time, and won't let you use the money you have in your account. It's impossible to get a straight answer from them and I fear I made a mistake banking with them in the first place. Very sketchy behavior and I do not trust them with my money what so ever.",2025-03-27,1
It's ALWAYS something...! I recently went back to using the full website.,2025-03-27,1
Terrible customer service.My automated payment dissapeared.They are passive agressive.Waited 30 min for a supervisor.They are amateurs versus Ollo.Now couple months later i have more problems.They block my card and i have 3 accounts with them they saying fraud!!I want it to buy an airline ticket!!They blocked it i called them and the card and they say we unllocked it.The airline tried couple times and gave up.Worse credit card company.Still locked after checking.Pathetic.,2025-03-25,1
always crashes when making trades,2025-03-25,1
"Hit or miss. Usually get a pop-up that says they ""can't bring me to my account right now... check your wi-fi"" Like that's the problem. JH, your app sucks. I wonder if SoFi's is better.",2025-03-25,1
This app is garbage and crashes a lot!,2025-03-24,1
"Constantly logs me out, and biometrics are never saved. Zelle with Ally always takes days to transfer. Super inconvenient.",2025-03-21,1
"I can not access ANY information on this app. This has been ongoing for over a year. What is the deal?!?! Every time I try and view my documents, or look at statements. ""internal error"" or ""something went wrong on our end."" But to make a payment is flawless. I never have an issue accessing that. Go figure! I will not be dealing with Ally after this. This is a headache I do not need.",2025-03-21,1
"Always down or slow. The bank is for remote use, but the App is always slow or asking you to call. Terrible piece of garbage. It's 2025. Get it together.",2025-03-21,1
"I regularly deposit checks with the bank of America app and it's instant. First check I deposit through the ally app and it's been a week with it being flagged for ""inconsistencies"". So I guess the lesson is use a real bank for deposits and transfer to your fake online only bank later for the high interest. Services don't seem ready for prime time.",2025-03-21,1
if I could leave 0 stars i would they take to long to take money out and customer support sucks,2025-03-20,1
it's crazy that I can only access my account and view buckets about 50% of the time due to server issues on their end. moving away from ally soon. garbage service.,2025-03-20,1
Not sure why this app has 4.5 stars. Haven't been able to use the app for payments since i downloaded it and that's the only reason i downloaded anyway.,2025-03-20,1
Unable to access my account after it automatically updated,2025-03-18,1
Ally will not let me pay my credit card payment via bank account any more. They make it very difficult to pay them. They are completely rude and uncooperative. Will never be a customer of theirs again. Completely unacceptable business practices.,2025-03-17,1
"Forced update links to DOWNLOAD NEW app, NOT UPDATE. SCAM. Trust is everything in a bank. All neg reviews get same response: ""Hi, we don't like hearing this, please call us..."" No. I will not call your customer service. Get your money out. I'm LEAVING Ally because of this app. If I could give less stars...",2025-03-17,1
Buggiest App Ever - Constantly have to Force Close and reopen for it to work,2025-03-17,1
I would love to give this a fair rating but I installed the app and tried to create an account. I had type in my SSN and DOB then confirm. Only it tells me something went wrong everytime I attempt it effectively blocking me from creating an account and I am not going to call Ally like it advises just to create an account. That is ridiculous. Fix this!,2025-03-15,1
App has a design flaw where it doesn't work if you have a VPN enabled. You'd think for an online bank they'd put more thought into their customers online security.,2025-03-14,1
This is the worst app I've ever used. I pay all of my bills online. This one point blank sucks.,2025-03-14,1
Takes forever to load and some doesn't let me sign in.,2025-03-12,1

"Cant login to my ally auto account bc the app no longer works, this app doesnt have my info on it 0/10 financial institution",2025-03-10,1
Terrible app. Does not save login information let alone biometrics information and good luck if you forgot your username or password. The app takes forever to send you any codes to your email or text or it just doesn't send at all. I even tested it with 3 separate numbers and still does it.,2025-03-09,1
"I can't get anything to work. I have called the phone number and chat SEVERAL TIMES, received information, attempted opening my account...and nothing. I have wasted several hours on this and I am sick of it. Ally has the worst customer service department I have used.",2025-03-08,1
"haven't been able to login for over a month, just keeps giving an error",2025-03-08,1
Used to be a great bank but the last two weeks have been a nightmare and customer service isn't what it used to be.,2025-03-07,1
"Update 2025: app gets worse every month, failure rate 50% for login. I use 18 different financial services apps (most are banks). Of all of them, only one other has as unreliable login as ally. The biometrics login on ally still is broken, years later. It works half the time at best. Even when it works, the app is regularly broken, showing ""sorry a maintenance is happening"", but if you restart it then it works (so, not a maintenance). It's also just insanely slow.

Finally cancelled my account. Good riddance. I highly suggest doing this on a computer because you can't see what you are typing on the app. It made things far more cumbersome than they needed to be. I only used this account as a fun money one so it wasn't much of a loss.,2025-02-27,1

This has nothing to do with that app. This company and it's employees are not on the same page. I don't know if it's training or lack of communication. Customer service has has given us 3 different answers when it comes explaining the lease turn in process. Which was also different from what the dealer expected was going to happen. My advice to anyone who already using this company is to bypass regular agents and ask for manager directly. They seem to be the only ones who have a grasp on policy.,2025-01-08,1
It used to be easy to sign in with my code. They changed everything around a while back and it takes a day or 2 to sign in now.

Zelle history doesn't display, account history doesn't display, and half the time finger print login doesn't work which forces me to restart the app. I also don't need to see an unnecessary animation each time I start the app, I just want to see my accounts. They also forcing a Zelle QR code splash screen EVERY single time even after I've declined it every single time. It's ridiculous. Do the engineers test this stuff before release?",2025-05-02,2
"Love the bank, hate the app. It frequently fails to load transactions. Distributing funds in my buckets often blocks out moving money from my unbucketed area even when there is money there to transfer. I have to login in my computer to distribute often. The app often also fails to load my recent transactions.",2025-05-02,2
"Earlier this week, I had issues logging in. Then today, there are more login issues. After many tries of closing and opening the app, I was able to log in. Then I find out Zelle doesn't work.",2025-05-02,2
"This is the glitchiest app ever. It is constantly saying that my banking information is unavailable, and ""they are working on it."" I'm sorry, but this isn't some game, this is my money that I use to run my business! It is a little scary when both the app and the online website are down and I can't access my banking info. Do better! I wish I would have used Relay bank instead of Ally. If this keeps happening I might switch to Relay.",2025-05-02,2
"suddenly you can't make transfers in the app?? what's the point then? and the website will not log you in until you receive a text. I do not have phone service where I am, why can you not just send an email?? can't do a single thing.",2025-05-02,2
"Cannot login via app or laptop across 3 different browsers. App is broken AGAIN after latest update. Endless issues with the website and the app: freezes, timeouts, error messages, etc., and every update brings new problems. I transferred the bulk of my money to a different bank a few months ago when the issues impacted a down payment wire transfer... never trust Ally as your main bank because they WILL fail and you won't be able to access your accounts when you need them in a hurry.",2025-05-01,2
"Ally has some strange policies that cause unnecessary problems. I recently had fraud on my credit card, but instead of just giving me a new card number, they closed the entire account and opened a new one. This negatively affected my credit score in a way that will take a long time to recover from... for no good reason! The only good thing about Ally is their ""buckets"" feature for savings accounts.",2025-05-01,2
Ally has apparently activated Zelle in my account and apparently is having a great deal of difficulty in revoking its unauthorized action.,2025-04-28,2
Please fix your app never been late on a payment and dont want to start now called as requested still say I have a auto code and password I haven't had a vehicle with ally in 5 years and you want me to remember a cars info from 5 years ago I just want to pay my cc there is nothing to link and called different departments and the send you to someone else pointless,2025-04-26,2
App hasn't worked in months. Kind of a big deal if you're an online-only bank.,2025-04-25,2
Latest update makes you go through an ad/marketing splash menu before logging in. I've already downloaded the app... Why are you advertising to people that are already customers? Very annoying.,2025-04-24,2
8 days to cash a check in 2025 is ridiculous. I am absolutely switching to a different bank over this.,2025-04-23,2
"been using for years and it is getting absolutely insane. you cannot use a VPN to protect your own data when you log in. if your biometrics doesnt catch the VERY FIRST try, you have to completely close the app and again... and again... and too many tries actually locks you out of the entire account. after (if) you log in, they delay a ""notification"" just long enough so that your thumb is over the spam instead of where you actually wanted to tap.",2025-04-22,2
RUN FROM THIS BANK IM WARNING YOU THEY ARE TERRIBLE!!!! I HAD MY BANK HERE FOR 8 YEARS AND THEY CLOSED MY ACCOUNTS WITH NO WARNING AND WONT GIVE ME MY MONEY BACK!! ITS BEEN 14 DAYS!!!,2025-04-21,2
"The credentials that will log me in to the Web site and the old version of the app do not work on this new version. I just tried again. I logged on to Chrome no problem. This app still says my credentials are wrong. It's not me it's not my credentials it's this app. Still 1 star. and again the app, using credentials I just used to sign on to the web site, still says I have the wind credentials and wants me to change my password. The UN & PW are fine in the website. Zero stars app totally useless",2025-04-20,2
"the app really sucks. when it's works it's fine, but I have to uninstall and reinstall it usually twice a week, sometimes more, due to a random bug where it just says ""our system is unavailable."" if I don't reinstall it will just say that for days at a time and I can't use the app at all.",2025-04-18,2
Terrible app. Never works. I don't have the time to call which is what it always tells me to do. why have an app if it doesn't work?,2025-04-17,2

Can't even set up anything. Put in the date of birth and social and it says something's not right. I have never had an account with them,2025-04-17,2
"Complete garbage. It's so buggy, it will remove your auto payment and hurt your credit. If you want your credit destroyed, use ally. Think I'm just a random angry customer? Check their social media. a class action lawsuit is about to hit them in the face for this. i spoke to customer service already. you don't threaten your customers credit and get away with it. so I'm not changing my review. if you can permanently affect me with my credit. I'll do the same with this review",2025-04-15,2
have had to call multiple times for issues,2025-04-15,2

horrible,2025-04-06,2
I just tried to mobile deposit a 5 times check. But it keeps giving me the error of check needs to be flat and all corners visible. Whoever updated this app is an idiot and needs to be fired. The just made this app useless to me.,2025-04-04,2
"ever since the update the app crashes, unenrolls my biometrics, has an error message at login. one of the worse downgrade I've ever experienced with an app. I'm considering switching banks because of this app",2025-04-04,2
I haven't been able to log in my account for 3 weeks. I call ally and I get a call center overseas and I cannot understand there language all I want to do is access my account and cannot get past login page UPDATE. I responded to the response on this review by Ally and it's now been 9 days with no response. Still couldn't understand person when I call because they barely speak English. Worst Customer service I've ever seen,2025-04-04,2
they try to make a payment for a week and not working,2025-04-04,2
"The app is clunky, difficult to navigate, slow, and Zelle is just the worst! I would recommend other online banking before Ally.",2025-04-03,2
"The app was great when we first got our loan. Within the last 3 months, I haven't been able to make payments on the app or online. I've messaged with customer service on the app, and it falls on deaf ears constantly. They give you a number to call, and 30 minutes later, you might have someone to talk to, but they quickly transfer you, and you are waiting again. Very disappointed with the whole Ally experience",2025-04-03,2
I can't set up to pay my payment I've been trying 4 weeks. I have taked to Reps none of them have fixed the problem.,2025-04-02,2
Great bank garbage app,2025-04-02,2
I was not able to make any zelle transfers from my checking And there was no option in the app to change it. and chat couldn't help me,2025-04-02,2
This app barely works if you have a VPN active. More often than not I can't sign in at all unless I disconnect from it and I'm unwilling to sacrifice privacy for their policies.,2025-04-01,2
somehow every single time I open this app it's down and I am unable to make a payment. it's crazy.,2025-04-01,2

app always crashing unreliable,2025-03-31,2

"Ally bank App doesn't work today, I'm disappointed",2025-03-31,2
"Ally Bank locks you from accessing your money. The app is terrible at 'switching' the 'to' and 'from' accounts. you think you're sending it in one direction, and then you find out it's going in the other direction. This is the only financial institution app I have ever had such problems. Ally says they don't charge fees, which they don't, but they lock you out of accessing your money. What a terrible company. No one at the call centers are able to answer these questions either.",2025-03-31,2
"Unable to deposit checks via the app - the image capture is not able to capture a satisfactory image no matter what. In addition, the app fails to load/log-in more than 75% of the time - you have to force-quit it to get it to work each time. These are bread-and-butter capabilities, and their lack is making me consider if I need a different institution that takes customer access platforms seriously, especially for an online- only financial institution.",2025-03-30,2
"it sucks, the company sucks. i want my extra payments to go toward principal, not my next payment",2025-03-30,2
never allows me to log in,2025-03-28,2
The app is constantly unavailable - it looks to be related to biometrics authentication. Whenever this happens I will annoyingly just login to the web app - but it took me forever to realize that the app is experiencing issues and not just Ally as a whole. PLEASE FIX THIS. [this is the 3rd update of this review],2025-03-28,2

"For the second time, my spending buckets have disappeared from my checking account and no response from Ally as to how to fix it.",2025-03-27,2
Update: the app has been dog slow for the past few months and overall service of the bank has been degrading throughout the years. Ally is not the prime online bank it once was.,2025-03-27,2
"Do not trust this company with your money. Their off shore agents will lie to you, waste your time, and won't let you use the money you have in your account. It's impossible to get a straight answer from them and I fear I made a mistake banking with them in the first place. Very sketchy behavior and I do not trust them with my money what so ever.",2025-03-27,2
It's ALWAYS something...! I recently went back to using the full website.,2025-03-27,2
Terrible customer service.My automated payment dissapeared.They are passive agressive.Waited 30 min for a supervisor.They are amateurs versus Ollo.Now couple months later i have more problems.They block my card and i have 3 accounts with them they saying fraud!!I want it to buy an airline ticket!!They blocked it i called them and the card and they say we unllocked it.The airline tried couple times and gave up.Worse credit card company.Still locked after checking.Pathetic.,2025-03-25,2

This app is garbage and crashes a lot!,2025-03-24,2

"I can not access ANY information on this app. This has been ongoing for over a year. What is the deal?!?! Every time I try and view my documents, or look at statements. ""internal error"" or ""something went wrong on our end."" But to make a payment is flawless. I never have an issue accessing that. Go figure! I will not be dealing with Ally after this. This is a headache I do not need.",2025-03-21,2
"Always down or slow. The bank is for remote use, but the App is always slow or asking you to call. Terrible piece of garbage. It's 2025. Get it together.",2025-03-21,2
"I regularly deposit checks with the bank of America app and it's instant. First check I deposit through the ally app and it's been a week with it being flagged for ""inconsistencies"". So I guess the lesson is use a real bank for deposits and transfer to your fake online only bank later for the high interest. Services don't seem ready for prime time.",2025-03-21,2
if I could leave 0 stars i would they take to long to take money out and customer support sucks,2025-03-20,2
it's crazy that I can only access my account and view buckets about 50% of the time due to server issues on their end. moving away from ally soon. garbage service.,2025-03-20,2
Not sure why this app has 4.5 stars. Haven't been able to use the app for payments since i downloaded it and that's the only reason i downloaded anyway.,2025-03-20,2
Unable to access my account after it automatically updated,2025-03-18,2
Ally will not let me pay my credit card payment via bank account any more. They make it very difficult to pay them. They are completely rude and uncooperative. Will never be a customer of theirs again. Completely unacceptable business practices.,2025-03-17,2
"Forced update links to DOWNLOAD NEW app, NOT UPDATE. SCAM. Trust is everything in a bank. All neg reviews get same response: ""Hi, we don't like hearing this, please call us..."" No. I will not call your customer service. Get your money out. I'm LEAVING Ally because of this app. If I could give less stars...",2025-03-17,2
Buggiest App Ever - Constantly have to Force Close and reopen for it to work,2025-03-17,2
I would love to give this a fair rating but I installed the app and tried to create an account. I had type in my SSN and DOB then confirm. Only it tells me something went wrong everytime I attempt it effectively blocking me from creating an account and I am not going to call Ally like it advises just to create an account. That is ridiculous. Fix this!,2025-03-15,2
App has a design flaw where it doesn't work if you have a VPN enabled. You'd think for an online bank they'd put more thought into their customers online security.,2025-03-14,2
This is the worst app I've ever used. I pay all of my bills online. This one point blank sucks.,2025-03-14,2

"Cant login to my ally auto account bc the app no longer works, this app doesnt have my info on it 0/10 financial institution",2025-03-10,2
Terrible app. Does not save login information let alone biometrics information and good luck if you forgot your username or password. The app takes forever to send you any codes to your email or text or it just doesn't send at all. I even tested it with 3 separate numbers and still does it.,2025-03-09,2
"I can't get anything to work. I have called the phone number and chat SEVERAL TIMES, received information, attempted opening my account...and nothing. I have wasted several hours on this and I am sick of it. Ally has the worst customer service department I have used.",2025-03-08,2

Used to be a great bank but the last two weeks have been a nightmare and customer service isn't what it used to be.,2025-03-07,2
"Update 2025: app gets worse every month, failure rate 50% for login. I use 18 different financial services apps (most are banks). Of all of them, only one other has as unreliable login as ally. The biometrics login on ally still is broken, years later. It works half the time at best. Even when it works, the app is regularly broken, showing ""sorry a maintenance is happening"", but if you restart it then it works (so, not a maintenance). It's also just insanely slow. Zelle also slow",2025-03-07,2
"Always unavailable, chat window is broken on Android and you can't see what you're typing, support isn't always helpful. Wait times are longer than they used to be.",2025-03-04,2

God help anyone trying to execute trades with this app. Often unusable.,2025-03-04,2
This is the worst app I have ever tried to use! I recently purchased a vehicle and they told me to use this app to make my auto payment. And the app has never worked and trying to speak to. Customer service been a nightmare. Because they keep referring me back to the website that does not work.,2025-03-04,2
Siempre que necesito pagar . Se demoran mucho en atenderme,2025-03-03,2
Never used might be good don't know,2025-03-02,2

The app doesn't work!,2025-02-27,2
This app stinks anymore! I cant even login it won't even get me to that screen before it closes out.,2025-02-27,2
Finally cancelled my account. Good riddance. I highly suggest doing this on a computer because you can't see what you are typing on the app. It made things far more cumbersome than they needed to be. I only used this account as a fun money one so it wasn't much of a loss.,2025-02-27,2
wouldn't recommend even if they pay you 100 to open account,2025-02-26,2
takes long time to do transfer. it's very hard to take picture to do deposits checks,2025-02-26,2

stay away from this institution! One step below a loan shark anf the worse customer service you can imagine.,2025-02-25,2
often not able to open the app,2025-02-24,2
Terrible app. Many have posted about the problems but they continue. I don't need to call you to hear that you are working on it. An online bank should be on top of the issues.,2025-02-23,2
"Terrible customer service from their help desk. All Indian agents and cannot understand what they are saying. Avoid Ally..............So they responded with the message below. I emailed them at the address provided. 15 days later, absolutely no response and no resolution to my issue of being locked out of my account. Completely a joke of a company to deal with.

The rest of the app has constant error codes, making simple tasks take a long time.",2025-02-20,2
"I wouldn't recommend this app or even being a customer of Ally Invest. 1. The app doesn't allow you to Buy to Cover your short position! For some reason it's treated as opening a new long position, and it tells you that you have insufficient buying power to close your short! And it's been like that for years without getting fixed! 2. Their desktop site has been down multiple times over the last year so I couldn't trade when my stocks were moving a lot. 3. They fleece you with trading fees.",2025-02-18,2

"Tried to sign up for this bank because it looked decent and I wanted to get away from Current. I was denied 3 times because they couldn't verify my identity? I then called the customer service number, and the rep was absolutely no help, basically kept repeatedly himself that there's nothing they can do, keep putting in an application otherwise nothing they can do and went on about why he couldn't transfer me to any other department to help me, so I just hung up. I went with Cash App instead.",2025-02-17,2

Check still hasn't arrived and I'm stranded in the desert with no money for fuel, water, or food. I asked them to cancel the check they claimed they sent and overnight me one to my location and they said they can't and will call me back.

"Biometric login has been broken for a solid month now. It's like the prompt gets covered up by an invisible activity, because it stops accepting input. Pixel 9 Pro with fingerprint scanner and secure face unlock (Class 3).

You'll get more than 1 stars when your app lets me transfer between invest accounts. Utterly useless. Edit: this review was posted after I called them and they couldn't help.

Ally Credit card has by far the worst customer service! My account was flagged for fraud and they required documents to be faxed..

This has nothing to do with that app. This company and it's employees are not on the same page. I don't know if it's training or lack of communication. Customer service has has given us 3 different answers when it comes explaining the lease turn in process. Which was also different from what the dealer expected was going to happen. My advice to anyone who already using this company is to bypass regular agents and ask for manager directly. They seem to be the only ones who have a grasp on policy.,2025-01-08,2
It used to be easy to sign in with my code. They changed everything around a while back and it takes a day or 2 to sign in now.

Allys app used to have push notifications for debit card transactions. I contacted support and this option is no longer available and you can only choose text or email. Problem with that is those notifications often come delayed (24-48 hours after the transaction occurred). My other banks still use push notifications so I don't understand why Ally removed this.

"App is horribly unstable and doesn't let me login because ""the error might be on our side."" Seems to be more stable now but I have to turn off my VPN to get login to work.

"I generally like using Ally for my savings and checking account. These last couple of months though have been horrendous in terms of app usage. When I type in my correct password or attempt a biometrics login (only typed in once), it will state that I have attempted too many login attempts, need a password reset and my account is locked. It is extraordinarily frustrating having to reset my password everytime I want to login from the app. Please fix this bug. I'm so close to switching out",2024-10-28,2
"While I've enjoyed my experience with Ally overall, I replaced my phone with the exact same model and it now states the Ally app isn't available on my device. Previously to this I was already having difficulty at login. This makes it extremely tough to check my balance and pay bills on the go. I feel a working phone app for an online banking system should be a non-negotiable. I just hope these issues are solved sooner rather than later.",2024-10-25,2
"I'm encountering more and more errors in the app. What's going on? I've been with ally for years and never had so many issues with the app. Ally is an ONLINE bank, you would think there would be more focus on maintaining the app and website.",2024-10-14,2

Regular 'experiencing connectivity issues' errors, all kinds of flakiness with the biometric login even on a Pixel 8 Pro where even after I authenticate it'll just pop back to the login screen, or I hit the 'enroll in biometric login' button and it just doesn't do that. I hit the biometric login switch manually in the app and it works for a bit but still flakes out within a week",2024-10-07,2

"Don't ever bank with these guys (or any other bank that doesn't have a physical location). The reason is that if your card gets disabled because of fraud you have 1 of 2 options. 1. You can take the hit and continue using the card. 2. You can report it as fraud and not have access to your funds. They will also not allow you to transfer what you have in your account to a different account so that you can use the money. In short, just use a real bank",2024-10-01,2

I would say at least half the time I try to log in I'm told it can't access my accounts right now and won't log me in, which is extremely annoying if I'm trying to check my bank account balance before making an online purchase. I've also had biometric login randomly turned off without my doing anything to initiate that change a couple of times.",2024-08-18,2
"Apparently the app is no longer compatiable with Android devices. Unable to trade or do much from app. That's unacceptable. The entire point of an app is on the go convenience and quick access to accounts. So it makes you reconsider using Ally for banking if you can't actually do what you need to do.

I would love to give this a fair rating but I installed the app and tried to create an account. I had type in my SSN and DOB then confirm.

That is ridiculous. Fix this!,2025-03-15,3

Too many updates. 2 year update: Now this app is incompatible with my phone. How can they no longer support the app for my phone & my money still be in their bank? Ridiculous,2025-03-01,3
Can't log in. Text doesn't work. Garbage app,2025-02-28,3
The app doesn't work!,2025-02-27,3
This app stinks anymore! I cant even login it won't even get me to that screen before it closes out.,2025-02-27,3
Finally cancelled my account. Good riddance. I highly suggest doing this on a computer because you can't see what you are typing on the app. It made things far more cumbersome than they needed to be. I only used this account as a fun money one so it wasn't much of a loss.,2025-02-27,3
wouldn't recommend even if they pay you 100 to open account,2025-02-26,3
takes long time to do transfer. it's very hard to take picture to do deposits checks,2025-02-26,3

often not able to open the app,2025-02-24,3
Terrible app. Many have posted about the problems but they continue. I don't need to call you to hear that you are working on it. An online bank should be on top of the issues.,2025-02-23,3
"Terrible customer service from their help desk. All Indian agents and cannot understand what they are saying. Avoid Ally..............So they responded with the message below. I emailed them at the address provided. 15 days later, absolutely no response and no resolution to my issue of being locked out of my account. Completely a joke of a company to deal with. Anyone thinking of doing business with their investment firm and having your IRA with them, I would seriously think twice.",2025-02-22,3

"App runs terrible. Great concept, doesn't work. Also terrible user protection. We got chared for two hotel rooms rather then one. But ally determined it ""was authorized"" even though we didn't get two rooms. App: the buckets function atrociously, and half the time dont even open. The rest of the app has constant error codes, making simple tasks take a long time.",2025-02-20,3
"I wouldn't recommend this app or even being a customer of Ally Invest. 1. The app doesn't allow you to Buy to Cover your short position! For some reason it's treated as opening a new long position, and it tells you that you have insufficient buying power to close your short! And it's been like that for years without getting fixed! 2. Their desktop site has been down multiple times over the last year so I couldn't trade when my stocks were moving a lot. 3. They fleece you with trading fees.",2025-02-18,3
The app never opens on the first time and I often get error messages that I can view my account details. Which is really crazy for an online bank.,2025-02-17,3
"Tried to sign up for this bank because it looked decent and I wanted to get away from Current. I was denied 3 times because they couldn't verify my identity? I then called the customer service number, and the rep was absolutely no help, basically kept repeatedly himself that there's nothing they can do, keep putting in an application otherwise nothing they can do and went on about why he couldn't transfer me to any other department to help me, so I just hung up. I went with Cash App instead.",2025-02-17,3
That worest app and bank it is confused,2025-02-16,3

First image on app got stuck Loading. Tried three times, then did it the long way before anything happened on the app. Immediately uninstalled.",2025-02-16,3
"The app works great. Worst bank ever. Closed my account unexpectedly without warning and said they'd ""mail me a check"" for the very large sum that was in my account. Check still hasn't arrived and I'm stranded in the desert with no money for fuel, water, or food. I asked them to cancel the check they claimed they sent and overnight me one to my location and they said they can't and will call me back.

"Would give it 0 stars if that was an option. The app never takes out my auto pay, and the customer service is horrible . Every month, I have trouble with my payment, and they always make me late.

Doesn't work!,2025-02-13,3

App constantly crashes,2025-02-12,3
"This app is frustrating me to the point of contemplating transferring my money out and closing my accounts.

"Your spending buckets are a complete mess, especially for Android users. You had a simple task to give your users the same control over distribution of buckets and accounts similar to the savings buckets. Now you have auto distribution or manual entry and even if I do manual entry I can't hit enter because the enter button isn't optimized for Android, it's covered up by the bottom of the screen.

I don't know why they have biometric login as an option when it has never once saved on the account.,2025-02-04,3
"Biometric login has been broken for a solid month now. It's like the prompt gets covered up by an invisible activity, because it stops accepting input. Pixel 9 Pro with fingerprint scanner and secure face unlock (Class 3). It's like Ally auto-rejects the initial face scan because it doesn't know Android phones now have Class 3 facial recognition, then refuses to let me scan my finger. Bug is definitely on Ally's end.",2025-02-04,3

Pure and utter garbage!,2025-01-31,3
"I'm not sure what happened to Ally recently, but I've used them for years. They are recently so hamstrung with internal red tape and technology fails it's sad. I hope they can get it together before it's too late. Thank you for the reply. I've been calling in a lot lately. It seems no one on the other end has authority or capability to do anything. It's always we will have someone call you back in one to two business days, but they don't call back, it's just a delay tactic.",2025-01-30,3
Needs themed icon support for Pixel phones.,2025-01-30,3
"Customer service is a joke. I have been trying to get an issue resolved for months. The service department can only escalate a claim and apologize. Issues are supposed to be handled in 10 business days, not months, but nobody can give you an answer when things will be handled. I like the user interface and some of the gimmicks like buckets, but not enough to deal with being lied to. I'll go get a HYSA at another bank that will give me 1% better and have some integrity. **update: no change",2025-01-28,3

You'll get more than 1 stars when your app lets me transfer between invest accounts. Utterly useless. Edit: this review was posted after I called them and they couldn't help. So the developer response is of course equally useless. Stop wasting time responding and start spending time developing.,2025-01-26,3
"Recent payments don't show up on transactions, made a payment got an email that next day saying they still haven't received payment, so I checked and didn't see one, made another payment then both hit the next day, called customer service and was told they couldn't return duplicate payments even though their system was still showing no payments made when there clearly was one.

"It takes such a long time to perform a transfer to external accounts by Ally. These transactions are instant and in this 21st century it in fact happens in seconds, but Ally holds to your money some 4 business days which is just greed.

There are quite some banks that pay much higher interest than Ally, like My Banking Direct by Flagstar Bank.",2025-01-24,3
"Not off to a good start. Just opened my accounts. Then, I downloaded the app, and it tells me, ""we can't show your accounts right now."" I read the app reviews and was worried about this, but I like the account offerings. However, if I can't use the app, I won't be making my initial deposit to get started.

"I used to think that ally bank was a fantastic bank but after the experience I've had with them repeatedly, 7 times in a row, claiming that a check didn't have my name on it when anyone with decent eye sight could see that my name IS on it.

Ally Credit card has by far the worst customer service! My account was flagged for fraud and they required documents to be faxed.. I have sent 4 faxes at this point and they claim that they haven't recieved it. They coincidentally froze my account after I paid the balance in full. Unreal! Closing this card once this is lifted.,2025-01-11,3

This has nothing to do with that app. This company and it's employees are not on the same page. I don't know if it's training or lack of communication. Customer service has has given us 3 different answers when it comes explaining the lease turn in process. Which was also different from what the dealer expected was going to happen. My advice to anyone who already using this company is to bypass regular agents and ask for manager directly. They seem to be the only ones who have a grasp on policy.,2025-01-08,3
It used to be easy to sign in with my code. They changed everything around a while back and it takes a day or 2 to sign in now. Most of the time I give up before I stroke out from aggravation and look for a number to call and pay the money to pay online. Every single time I have to change my password. I write it down and the next month it tells me it's not valid. I know it is and keep trying. It has me put in info over and over and doesn't move on. Even this page is just scrolling.,2025-01-08,3

Also, are you actively doing anything for people who can't make their payments because your busted app doesn't work?

I opened the app and first thing I see is some pointless story about a racecar driver. I don't want stories in my app. I don't want badges or stickers or trophies or whatever nonsense you think we want in a mobile banking app. I just want to check my balances and move money. Stop trying to make this into some silly social media app. Every single update seems to bring more junk to the app.,2025-04-24,3
The app is fine I guess but the bank is not. The communication is ridiculous.,2025-04-16,3

"Happy Ally customer for many years. First problem started a few days ago. If I try to switch to another app (ie Google sheets where I track my finances) and go back, I get a popup that says loading. Loading never completes. The only way to escape this is to close Ally and log in over again",2025-03-01,3
Often encounter errors using this app.,2025-03-01,3
Ally is great. the app has problems. the spending bucket system barely works.,2025-02-28,3
"As many others have said, as a bank, I enjoy Ally. There are some disadvantages like not being able to deposit cash directly but that can be solved by keeping another bank to do so. For the app on Android devices however, it is nothing short of a frustrating experience. App crashes, buckets greyed-out that have money in them, app glitches, the list goes one. I've had issues with our buckets since we got the bank which is really the only reason we use Ally. Terrible app.",2025-02-28,3
Frequently buggy. Needs an update to bring up the correct screen when clicking on spending buckets. The top navigation bar overlaps the notifications and camera. Often has to be forced closed because it cannot show my accounts despite being logged in.,2025-02-26,3
This app is useless if so many people need help but the chat feature doesn't work.,2025-02-26,3
"App login only works about half the time, and resets your login settings every time it fails to log you in. Very irritating to have so many hoops to jump through to manage your own money.",2025-02-25,3
"My primary use for mobile banking apps is to electronically deposit checks. However, this functionality has stopped working recently. After taking a photo of the check, it just hangs saying ""loading"" and the app has to be forcefully quit to get past it. Outside of that, the app seems fine. Unfortunately, I don't like using my phone for other banking functions, so the only one that really matters to me is broken... Making the app basically useless to me. 😕",2025-02-22,3
"I used to like this app. Now it keeps filling my wife's id and disabling my biometrics, It's my phone. Nothing I can do doesn't alter the behavior. Next step is to uninstall and install. Inexcusable",2025-02-21,3
e-deposit is terrible. takes a looooong time,2025-02-21,3
"I like the bank.... But this app is pretty much useless. The biggest issue with it is when I am going through my buckets and editing anything, the screen doesn't actually fit on my screen. I can't hit the done button because it's all the way up in the status bar area, meaning none of my changes ever safe. It's frustrating because I have to go to the computer to make these changes.",2025-02-18,3
The app continually forgets I'm signed up for biometrics and almost never lets me see my investment portfolio.,2025-02-17,3
the bank is okay to deal with the app has some quirks at the moment for mobile deposit.,2025-02-14,3
Was a good car loan company however their banking options suck. And customer service was rude,2025-02-13,3
"I trade a lot of options through this app. It is glitchy and counterintuitive on many order entries. The instructions will say to tap bid to sell or ask to buy on the option view, but I have to do thw opposite for the repopulate entries to show up correctly. I also have to enter it twice when editing legs. The app literally says whatever was there last time until I change the settings a second time. I've been trying to roll some puts all week and it just comes up ""null"" and fails.",2025-02-12,3
Frequently unavailable and constant update. Only offers sms or call by back for MFA. Need to offer something stronger,2025-02-07,3
"Needs updating or something. The app is always freezing, takes forever to load, and sometimes you can't even log in.",2025-02-06,3
Horrible bank needs work,2025-02-05,3
text overlaps or unable to see on chat box on the app makes it difficult to use it well. esp the spending buckets. I have to go on desktop to use.,2025-01-30,3
Good service and support. But logging in is consistently a pain. There's always some error with it that I don't have with desktop or like it won't send me security code even after hitting resend and opting in,2025-01-29,3
not very clear graphics need to update,2025-01-29,3
"My account was breached, and so I can't see how. So they need better security.",2025-01-28,3
online only. no ATM deposit. ATM withdrawal charges. transfers from bank to bank take too long.,2025-01-22,3
"If for whatever reason your payment goes late, do not pay it on the app. Tried to pay remaining balance plus get ahead and it didn't take the big payment so that got reported to the credit bureau. I tried calling customer service and they blamed me even though my one payment took to try to get ahead. I have had issues and had error codes thrown at me through the app while trying to make payments previously.",2025-01-22,3
Not the best lately I haven't been able to access buckets in one of my accounts for over a year and a half now!! Which is the reason I chose Ally Bank.,2025-01-15,3
couldnt change maturity instructions,2025-01-15,3
Unable to verify external accounts using the app. Forced to use a PC,2025-01-09,3
"It was great when I opened my account. Now I can't see transfers to my buckets after making them. When competing a transfer or other action, the X to close the current screen is hidden behind my phones status bar so I can't click it. The keyboard covers the text input in support chat so I can't see what I'm typing, I have to manually open and close my keyboard to see replies. I hope they fix the last update. It's miserable. I'm on a Pixel 8s",2025-01-08,3
Slow app and doesn't login about 50 percent of the time,2025-01-07,3
I've been trying to get in touch with customer service no one ever pick up the call I got blocked from my online banking there's nothing I can do now,2025-01-07,3
This was a good app until a few months ago when Zelle stopped working. Anytime I try to transfer money using the Zelle feature it encounters an error.,2025-01-06,3
"Ally doesn't protect your money when unauthorized charges show up. My card had 2 on there and i called in October when it happened. They reimbursed me for only 3 months, but undid those charges leaving me on the hook for them. Some hard to understand foreign person will always answer the phone which is why I won't even bother trying to fix this. Many other problems with them. After 8 years, I'm moving onto another bank. USAA is the bank before this and was much worse lol.",2025-01-05,3
"Marginally functional. Doesn't have all the features that Ally support thinks it has. (Push notifications for login authentication, for example.) EDIT: The feature is there, just not where support says it is.",2025-01-04,3
not intuitive. also wish that every transaction showed the running balance of account,2025-01-04,3
slow and account update alerts are late,2025-01-02,3
"Constant errors when trying to view transactions, edit accounts, etc. Always end up using desktop version to get anything done",2025-01-01,3
"App usually works fine, but I absolutely hate that they shut down the auto loan section from 12 am to 3 am every night to ""process payments."" Can't even check my balances during that time, and unfortunately as a night owl in a western time zone, that's usually when I'm working on the budget and need to see the balances or loan details. Seems like a needless inconvenience.",2025-01-01,3
"the interface for withdrawals makes this app increasingly frustrating to use without having to call a 1800 number to assist. especially Zelle, which should be the easiest way to transfer between accounts.",2025-01-01,3
Buggy. Sometimes requires multiple login attempts to function.,2024-12-26,3
"Rarely works on the weekend and lots of down time. Most common message seems to be ""we've got a snag""",2024-12-25,3
"It's a great app if it worked every time I need it. Please invest in fixing the app, having good service at all times.",2024-12-24,3
Biometric login never works.,2024-12-19,3
The app on pixel 9 pro is nearly unusable except maybe to see your balance. Using the keyboard is impossible without scrolling. Buttons are unable to be pressed as they are hidden under android's navigation UI. Labels for buttons are not aligned with the buttons. Notifications for spending buckets do not tell you which one was overspent which wastes time trying to find which one. Feel free to reach out to me about the issues.,2024-12-17,3
"The latest update made it so the app was too large for the screen. It goes beyond the navigation buttons on the bottom. You cannot confirm a mobile deposit because it only works on the navigation buttons, and the button to make the deposit is behind your navigation buttons. On Android",2024-12-14,3
"this app keeps logging me out and even though biometrics are turned on, I have to keep re-enrolling.",2024-12-12,3
"Historically the app is slow to load, and it seems to forget weekly that I've enrolled biometric authentication and makes me enter a password (helpfully reminding me that I should enroll in biometric...). In the latest version, it also makes it impossible to use Zelle because the android navigation buttons are on top of the Review button at the bottom of the screen. Worked around by switching to gesture navigation instead of 3-button. Annoying.",2024-12-11,3
"App is ok, but cannot process zelle at all since update",2024-12-04,3
"App is buggy. Since latest Android update, some features are broken because of UI issues between App and Android (app buttons are displayed in full screen, but are 'behind' android top and navigation bars, preventing App buttons from being able to be pressed). One other major complaint is that there are a lot of ""We Apologize Our system has encountered an error we are unable to recover from and your request is temporarily unavailable"" messages.",2024-12-04,3
"App is horribly unstable and doesn't let me login because ""the error might be on our side."" Seems to be more stable now but I have to turn off my VPN to get login to work. Will be looking into SoFi and I only switched over last year.. New UX is meh and is only overhauled on select screens but not all corners of the app. App icon is not yet compatible with Android's themed icons system setting.",2024-12-03,3
"The app is fine, when it works, which it rarely does. I have uninstalled and re-installed a handful of times. For the past 3 or 4 months it will not open, only crashes.",2024-12-02,3
Wire transfer could not be completed as app was down. App also takes time to load often.,2024-11-28,3
can not sign on to app,2024-11-24,3
Was a decent online bank but is now doing their best to block VPNs and leave you open to cyber attacks.,2024-11-21,3
"Usually I'm pretty satisfied with the app but lately I've been getting mostly ""can't connect to your account right now"" errors no matter what I do, with the occasional connection. Very inconvenient then you actually *need* to access your money. Just to clarify, apps like Cashapp, Walmart One and any other non Ally app connects without any issues.",2024-11-20,3

"I generally like using Ally for my savings and checking account. These last couple of months though have been horrendous in terms of app usage. When I type in my correct password or attempt a biometrics login (only typed in once), it will state that I have attempted too many login attempts, need a password reset and my account is locked. It is extraordinarily frustrating having to reset my password everytime I want to login from the app. Please fix this bug. I'm so close to switching out",2024-10-28,3
"While I've enjoyed my experience with Ally overall, I replaced my phone with the exact same model and it now states the Ally app isn't available on my device. Previously to this I was already having difficulty at login. This makes it extremely tough to check my balance and pay bills on the go. I feel a working phone app for an online banking system should be a non-negotiable. I just hope these issues are solved sooner rather than later.",2024-10-25,3
"I'm encountering more and more errors in the app. What's going on? I've been with ally for years and never had so many issues with the app. Ally is an ONLINE bank, you would think there would be more focus on maintaining the app and website.",2024-10-14,3
It is an easy to use banking app. But the text/email alerts have gotten very erratic. I may only get alerts half the time as of late.,2024-10-08,3
"It got a cosmetic facelifta few months ago but still feels like it's hosted on Geocities from a technical perspective. Regular 'experiencing connectivity issues' errors, all kinds of flakiness with the biometric login even on a Pixel 8 Pro where even after I authenticate it'll just pop back to the login screen, or I hit the 'enroll in biometric login' button and it just doesn't do that. I hit the biometric login switch manually in the app and it works for a bit but still flakes out within a week",2024-10-07,3
"Everything was fine until I paid my credit card and car payment. My bill was paid and then it says ""pending"" so they're attempting to take out two payments instead of the one.

"Don't ever bank with these guys (or any other bank that doesn't have a physical location). The reason is that if your card gets disabled because of fraud you have 1 of 2 options. 1. You can take the hit and continue using the card. 2. You can report it as fraud and not have access to your funds. They will also not allow you to transfer what you have in your account to a different account so that you can use the money. In short, just use a real bank",2024-10-01,3

I literally am not able to get any cash. They think it's a fraudulent transaction but it's me. In order to log in I need my US phone number which doesnt work here. In order to talk to customer service, they require a callback number which is my phone number which doesn't work in europe.",2024-09-17,3
This app is a complete joke.. Old dated slow and sluggish.. Ally maybe a good Bank 🏦 for using a computer but they're mobile app they're whole team doesn't have a clue how to build out a good mobile app.. They should find out and hunt down the app developers for Chase.. Wells Fargo and Citibank and see what a real good mobile banking app should be,2024-09-13,3
"There are many things that I love about this app, but I have to actually uninstall and reinstall at least once or twice a month. That means I have to reset passwords, re-established, biometrics, etc. This is not normal security activity. This is due to an actual error that says, "" we're sorry, but we can't take you to your account right now.""

I would say at least half the time I try to log in I'm told it can't access my accounts right now and won't log me in, which is extremely annoying if I'm trying to check my bank account balance before making an online purchase. I've also had biometric login randomly turned off without my doing anything to initiate that change a couple of times.",2024-08-18,3
"Apparently the app is no longer compatiable with Android devices. Unable to trade or do much from app. That's unacceptable. The entire point of an app is on the go convenience and quick access to accounts. So it makes you reconsider using Ally for banking if you can't actually do what you need to do.

"For the past few years I have used the Ally app to make my payments. A few months ago the app stopped working. Said I needed to use the updated app. I have spoken on the phone with a representative about this issue. They tell you which app to download and the same issue appears time and time again! The app just says ""oooops you are using the wrong app/version and to click below to connect. This does NOT seem like a safe app anymore to make my car payments!! 🤬",2024-05-14,3
Not all that. Can't send messages to them. Can't adjust due date or if you are facing hardship u can't make payments. I wish my car was financed elsewhere,2024-05-12,3
"Update - transaction search does not include deposit history. A lot left to be desired compared to a competing back - customer service, competent agents, ease of use in app. The buckets are useless, not current. All major points for this type of bank. Financially, I would rather use Ally, but other online banks are more appealing. Wish another bank had these buckets.",2024-05-11,3

"I was excited when learning dark mode was here. Then I realized how janky it was implemented. When you log in you start in dark mode, enter your biometric, get a white loading popup, then get a flash of a white screen then back to dark. Then you press on one of your accounts and you're back to light mode. Do it right or not at all. Dark mode is actually, dark, some light, blinding white, back to dark but eventually just light mode again. This needs a revert or immediate attention.",2024-05-08,3

"I am a little disconcerted to be someone with only an auto loan thru Ally (no banking/no investments) to be shunted onto a new platform at random. The old app seemed fine for scheduling payments without extras, so I'm confused as to why I need all this extra info now. Also why on earth is there a stories button - I'm probably on here for finances not to be launched to your blog.",2024-05-06,3

This by far is one of the best credit card banking institutions Hands down however this app has issues I have had my primary bank account blocked no fault of my own but because it does not reflect or show that your payment is pending it's as if you never attempted to pay and then if you pay again and the money is not available more than once they block your bank account when is clearly a error on their end for not displaying your payment people who like to pay their bill also want to see it.🫣,2024-05-24,3

"The new design for snapshot view and login is atrocious. White with purple writing??? The previous design of the app being purple was much better. Very clunky as if I put on accessibility options. Also, what's the point of having ""make a transfer"" under each account if when you click on one it doesn't populate the 'from' section with the account that you clicked make a transfer under?

It is not applied to the actual account view, just the snapshot, profile, and so on 2. The snapshot view is pretty badly designed in terms of usability. The ""Good morning, User"" header takes up too much real estate, and there is a callout for a blog article (probably AI-generated) that stops you from seeing your accounts without scrolling.",2024-03-30,3

horrible,2025-04-06,4
I just tried to mobile deposit a 5 times check. But it keeps giving me the error of check needs to be flat and all corners visible. Whoever updated this app is an idiot and needs to be fired. The just made this app useless to me.,2025-04-04,4
"ever since the update the app crashes, unenrolls my biometrics, has an error message at login. one of the worse downgrade I've ever experienced with an app. I'm considering switching banks because of this app",2025-04-04,4
I haven't been able to log in my account for 3 weeks. I call ally and I get a call center overseas and I cannot understand there language all I want to do is access my account and cannot get past login page UPDATE. I responded to the response on this review by Ally and it's now been 9 days with no response. Still couldn't understand person when I call because they barely speak English. Worst Customer service I've ever seen,2025-04-04,4
they try to make a payment for a week and not working,2025-04-04,4
"The app is clunky, difficult to navigate, slow, and Zelle is just the worst! I would recommend other online banking before Ally.",2025-04-03,4
"The app was great when we first got our loan. Within the last 3 months, I haven't been able to make payments on the app or online. I've messaged with customer service on the app, and it falls on deaf ears constantly. They give you a number to call, and 30 minutes later, you might have someone to talk to, but they quickly transfer you, and you are waiting again. Very disappointed with the whole Ally experience",2025-04-03,4
I can't set up to pay my payment I've been trying 4 weeks. I have taked to Reps none of them have fixed the problem.,2025-04-02,4
Great bank garbage app,2025-04-02,4
I was not able to make any zelle transfers from my checking And there was no option in the app to change it. and chat couldn't help me,2025-04-02,4
This app barely works if you have a VPN active. More often than not I can't sign in at all unless I disconnect from it and I'm unwilling to sacrifice privacy for their policies.,2025-04-01,4
somehow every single time I open this app it's down and I am unable to make a payment. it's crazy.,2025-04-01,4

app always crashing unreliable,2025-03-31,4

"Ally bank App doesn't work today, I'm disappointed",2025-03-31,4
"Ally Bank locks you from accessing your money. The app is terrible at 'switching' the 'to' and 'from' accounts. you think you're sending it in one direction, and then you find out it's going in the other direction. This is the only financial institution app I have ever had such problems. Ally says they don't charge fees, which they don't, but they lock you out of accessing your money. What a terrible company. No one at the call centers are able to answer these questions either.",2025-03-31,4
"Unable to deposit checks via the app - the image capture is not able to capture a satisfactory image no matter what. In addition, the app fails to load/log-in more than 75% of the time - you have to force-quit it to get it to work each time. These are bread-and-butter capabilities, and their lack is making me consider if I need a different institution that takes customer access platforms seriously, especially for an online- only financial institution.",2025-03-30,4
"it sucks, the company sucks. i want my extra payments to go toward principal, not my next payment",2025-03-30,4
never allows me to log in,2025-03-28,4
The app is constantly unavailable - it looks to be related to biometrics authentication. Whenever this happens I will annoyingly just login to the web app - but it took me forever to realize that the app is experiencing issues and not just Ally as a whole. PLEASE FIX THIS. [this is the 3rd update of this review],2025-03-28,4
"never works when you need it, and made me have one late payment on my credit.",2025-03-28,4
"For the second time, my spending buckets have disappeared from my checking account and no response from Ally as to how to fix it.",2025-03-27,4
Update: the app has been dog slow for the past few months and overall service of the bank has been degrading throughout the years. Ally is not the prime online bank it once was.,2025-03-27,4
"Do not trust this company with your money. Their off shore agents will lie to you, waste your time, and won't let you use the money you have in your account. It's impossible to get a straight answer from them and I fear I made a mistake banking with them in the first place. Very sketchy behavior and I do not trust them with my money what so ever.",2025-03-27,4
It's ALWAYS something...! I recently went back to using the full website.,2025-03-27,4
Terrible customer service.My automated payment dissapeared.They are passive agressive.Waited 30 min for a supervisor.They are amateurs versus Ollo.Now couple months later i have more problems.They block my card and i have 3 accounts with them they saying fraud!!I want it to buy an airline ticket!!They blocked it i called them and the card and they say we unllocked it.The airline tried couple times and gave up.Worse credit card company.Still locked after checking.Pathetic.,2025-03-25,4
always crashes when making trades,2025-03-25,4

This app is garbage and crashes a lot!,2025-03-24,4
"Constantly logs me out, and biometrics are never saved. Zelle with Ally always takes days to transfer. Super inconvenient.",2025-03-21,4
"I can not access ANY information on this app. This has been ongoing for over a year. What is the deal?!?! Every time I try and view my documents, or look at statements. ""internal error"" or ""something went wrong on our end."" But to make a payment is flawless. I never have an issue accessing that. Go figure! I will not be dealing with Ally after this. This is a headache I do not need.",2025-03-21,4
"Always down or slow. The bank is for remote use, but the App is always slow or asking you to call. Terrible piece of garbage. It's 2025. Get it together.",2025-03-21,4
"I regularly deposit checks with the bank of America app and it's instant. First check I deposit through the ally app and it's been a week with it being flagged for ""inconsistencies"". So I guess the lesson is use a real bank for deposits and transfer to your fake online only bank later for the high interest. Services don't seem ready for prime time.",2025-03-21,4
if I could leave 0 stars i would they take to long to take money out and customer support sucks,2025-03-20,4
it's crazy that I can only access my account and view buckets about 50% of the time due to server issues on their end. moving away from ally soon. garbage service.,2025-03-20,4
Not sure why this app has 4.5 stars. Haven't been able to use the app for payments since i downloaded it and that's the only reason i downloaded anyway.,2025-03-20,4
Unable to access my account after it automatically updated,2025-03-18,4
Ally will not let me pay my credit card payment via bank account any more. They make it very difficult to pay them. They are completely rude and uncooperative. Will never be a customer of theirs again. Completely unacceptable business practices.,2025-03-17,4
"Forced update links to DOWNLOAD NEW app, NOT UPDATE. SCAM. Trust is everything in a bank. All neg reviews get same response: ""Hi, we don't like hearing this, please call us..."" No. I will not call your customer service. Get your money out. I'm LEAVING Ally because of this app. If I could give less stars...",2025-03-17,4
Buggiest App Ever - Constantly have to Force Close and reopen for it to work,2025-03-17,4
I would love to give this a fair rating but I installed the app and tried to create an account. I had type in my SSN and DOB then confirm. Only it tells me something went wrong everytime I attempt it effectively blocking me from creating an account and I am not going to call Ally like it advises just to create an account. That is ridiculous. Fix this!,2025-03-15,4
App has a design flaw where it doesn't work if you have a VPN enabled. You'd think for an online bank they'd put more thought into their customers online security.,2025-03-14,4
This is the worst app I've ever used. I pay all of my bills online. This one point blank sucks.,2025-03-14,4

"Cant login to my ally auto account bc the app no longer works, this app doesnt have my info on it 0/10 financial institution",2025-03-10,4
Terrible app. Does not save login information let alone biometrics information and good luck if you forgot your username or password. The app takes forever to send you any codes to your email or text or it just doesn't send at all. I even tested it with 3 separate numbers and still does it.,2025-03-09,4
"I can't get anything to work. I have called the phone number and chat SEVERAL TIMES, received information, attempted opening my account...and nothing. I have wasted several hours on this and I am sick of it. Ally has the worst customer service department I have used.",2025-03-08,4
"haven't been able to login for over a month, just keeps giving an error",2025-03-08,4
Used to be a great bank but the last two weeks have been a nightmare and customer service isn't what it used to be.,2025-03-07,4
"Update 2025: app gets worse every month, failure rate 50% for login. I use 18 different financial services apps (most are banks). Of all of them, only one other has as unreliable login as ally. The biometrics login on ally still is broken, years later. It works half the time at best. Even when it works, the app is regularly broken, showing ""sorry a maintenance is happening"", but if you restart it then it works (so, not a maintenance). It's also just insanely slow. Zelle also slow",2025-03-07,4
"Always unavailable, chat window is broken on Android and you can't see what you're typing, support isn't always helpful. Wait times are longer than they used to be.",2025-03-04,4
"as a bank they are decent but their app sucks. especially the stock part of it is trash. useless unlabeled charts, unreliable constantly failing to show balances, poorly designed gain/loss display, etc",2025-03-04,4
God help anyone trying to execute trades with this app. Often unusable.,2025-03-04,4
This is the worst app I have ever tried to use! I recently purchased a vehicle and they told me to use this app to make my auto payment. And the app has never worked and trying to speak to. Customer service been a nightmare. Because they keep referring me back to the website that does not work.,2025-03-04,4
Siempre que necesito pagar . Se demoran mucho en atenderme,2025-03-03,4
Never used might be good don't know,2025-03-02,4
Too many updates. 2 year update: Now this app is incompatible with my phone. How can they no longer support the app for my phone & my money still be in their bank? Ridiculous,2025-03-01,4
Can't log in. Text doesn't work. Garbage app,2025-02-28,4
The app doesn't work!,2025-02-27,4
This app stinks anymore! I cant even login it won't even get me to that screen before it closes out.,2025-02-27,4
Finally cancelled my account. Good riddance. I highly suggest doing this on a computer because you can't see what you are typing on the app. It made things far more cumbersome than they needed to be. I only used this account as a fun money one so it wasn't much of a loss.,2025-02-27,4
wouldn't recommend even if they pay you 100 to open account,2025-02-26,4
takes long time to do transfer. it's very hard to take picture to do deposits checks,2025-02-26,4
Don't even try using Zelle.,2025-02-25,4
stay away from this institution! One step below a loan shark anf the worse customer service you can imagine.,2025-02-25,4
often not able to open the app,2025-02-24,4
Terrible app. Many have posted about the problems but they continue. I don't need to call you to hear that you are working on it. An online bank should be on top of the issues.,2025-02-23,4
"Terrible customer service from their help desk. All Indian agents and cannot understand what they are saying. Avoid Ally..............So they responded with the message below. I emailed them at the address provided. 15 days later, absolutely no response and no resolution to my issue of being locked out of my account. Completely a joke of a company to deal with. Anyone thinking of doing business with their investment firm and having your IRA with them, I would seriously think twice.",2025-02-22,4
This app is a horrible nightmare terrible,2025-02-21,4
Biometrics login constantly crashes and glitches,2025-02-21,4
"App runs terrible. Great concept, doesn't work. Also terrible user protection. We got chared for two hotel rooms rather then one. But ally determined it ""was authorized"" even though we didn't get two rooms. App: the buckets function atrociously, and half the time dont even open. The rest of the app has constant error codes, making simple tasks take a long time.",2025-02-20,4
"I wouldn't recommend this app or even being a customer of Ally Invest. 1. The app doesn't allow you to Buy to Cover your short position! For some reason it's treated as opening a new long position, and it tells you that you have insufficient buying power to close your short! And it's been like that for years without getting fixed! 2. Their desktop site has been down multiple times over the last year so I couldn't trade when my stocks were moving a lot. 3. They fleece you with trading fees.",2025-02-18,4
The app never opens on the first time and I often get error messages that I can view my account details. Which is really crazy for an online bank.,2025-02-17,4
"Tried to sign up for this bank because it looked decent and I wanted to get away from Current. I was denied 3 times because they couldn't verify my identity? I then called the customer service number, and the rep was absolutely no help, basically kept repeatedly himself that there's nothing they can do, keep putting in an application otherwise nothing they can do and went on about why he couldn't transfer me to any other department to help me, so I just hung up. I went with Cash App instead.",2025-02-17,4
That worest app and bank it is confused,2025-02-16,4
"Downloaded app so I didn't have to do the long, convoluted way of depositing checks by taking pics with phone, uploading to Drive, downloading to computer, and then uploading to Ally. First image on app got stuck Loading. Tried three times, then did it the long way before anything happened on the app. Immediately uninstalled.",2025-02-16,4
"The app works great. Worst bank ever. Closed my account unexpectedly without warning and said they'd ""mail me a check"" for the very large sum that was in my account. Check still hasn't arrived and I'm stranded in the desert with no money for fuel, water, or food. I asked them to cancel the check they claimed they sent and overnight me one to my location and they said they can't and will call me back. This is after I told them I have no working phone because they closed my account. RUN.",2025-02-15,4

"The capability to send a secure text email to customer service does not even show up. I do not want to upload any files, I just want customer service to look into my account. Please add the ability to send a secure message. This mobile app needs some features the customers can use, nof abunch of useless stuff. Please contract with a company that has some knowledge of coding to program mobile apps.",2025-02-14,4
"This app is no longer available for my phone (it used to be; my phone is a Cubot KK3), and I'm not going to buy a new phone just to get the app. I only need push notifications to work, so I don't really need (or want) the app in my phone (for security reasons, basically).",2025-02-14,4
"Would give it 0 stars if that was an option. The app never takes out my auto pay, and the customer service is horrible . Every month, I have trouble with my payment, and they always make me late.

App constantly crashes,2025-02-12,4
"This app is frustrating me to the point of contemplating transferring my money out and closing my accounts. It let's me get all the way to the transfer screen, then it crashes and says ""Ally closed because this app has a bug. Try clearing the app's cache, then reopen the app"".

"Your spending buckets are a complete mess, especially for Android users. You had a simple task to give your users the same control over distribution of buckets and accounts similar to the savings buckets. Now you have auto distribution or manual entry and even if I do manual entry I can't hit enter because the enter button isn't optimized for Android, it's covered up by the bottom of the screen.

I don't know why they have biometric login as an option when it has never once saved on the account.,2025-02-04,4
"Biometric login has been broken for a solid month now. It's like the prompt gets covered up by an invisible activity, because it stops accepting input. Pixel 9 Pro with fingerprint scanner and secure face unlock (Class 3). It's like Ally auto-rejects the initial face scan because it doesn't know Android phones now have Class 3 facial recognition, then refuses to let me scan my finger. Bug is definitely on Ally's end.",2025-02-04,4

Pure and utter garbage!,2025-01-31,4
"I'm not sure what happened to Ally recently, but I've used them for years. They are recently so hamstrung with internal red tape and technology fails it's sad. I hope they can get it together before it's too late. Thank you for the reply. I've been calling in a lot lately. It seems no one on the other end has authority or capability to do anything. It's always we will have someone call you back in one to two business days, but they don't call back, it's just a delay tactic.",2025-01-30,4
Needs themed icon support for Pixel phones.,2025-01-30,4
"Customer service is a joke. I have been trying to get an issue resolved for months. The service department can only escalate a claim and apologize. Issues are supposed to be handled in 10 business days, not months, but nobody can give you an answer when things will be handled.

You'll get more than 1 stars when your app lets me transfer between invest accounts. Utterly useless. Edit: this review was posted after I called them and they couldn't help. So the developer response is of course equally useless. Stop wasting time responding and start spending time developing.,2025-01-26,4
"Recent payments don't show up on transactions, made a payment got an email that next day saying they still haven't received payment, so I checked and didn't see one, made another payment then both hit the next day, called customer service and was told they couldn't return duplicate payments even though their system was still showing no payments made when there clearly was one.

"It takes such a long time to perform a transfer to external accounts by Ally.

Ally Credit card has by far the worst customer service! My account was flagged for fraud and they required documents to be faxed..

This has nothing to do with that app. This company and it's employees are not on the same page. I don't know if it's training or lack of communication. Customer service has has given us 3 different answers when it comes explaining the lease turn in process. Which was also different from what the dealer expected was going to happen. My advice to anyone who already using this company is to bypass regular agents and ask for manager directly. They seem to be the only ones who have a grasp on policy.,2025-01-08,4
It used to be easy to sign in with my code. They changed everything around a while back and it takes a day or 2 to sign in now. Most of the time I give up before I stroke out from aggravation and look for a number to call and pay the money to pay online. Every single time I have to change my password.

Allys app used to have push notifications for debit card transactions. I contacted support and this option is no longer available and you can only choose text or email. Problem with that is those notifications often come delayed (24-48 hours after the transaction occurred). My other banks still use push notifications so I don't understand why Ally removed this.

They should find out and hunt down the app developers for Chase.. Wells Fargo and Citibank and see what a real good mobile banking app should be,2024-09-13,4
"There are many things that I love about this app, but I have to actually uninstall and reinstall at least once or twice a month. That means I have to reset passwords, re-established, biometrics, etc. This is not normal security activity. This is due to an actual error that says, "" we're sorry, but we can't take you to your account right now."" I've spoken with support more than once, and their answer is always to uninstall and reinstall. While I love this bank, their app needs serious work.",2024-09-01,4

There is constant bugs on the app honestly. Constant errors when I wanna pay my bill.,2024-08-18,4
"I love Ally as my bank. Customer service has been great, no banking issues whatsoever. But the app? Extremely frustrating. I would say at least half the time I try to log in I'm told it can't access my accounts right now and won't log me in, which is extremely annoying if I'm trying to check my bank account balance before making an online purchase. I've also had biometric login randomly turned off without my doing anything to initiate that change a couple of times.",2024-08-18,4
"Apparently the app is no longer compatiable with Android devices. Unable to trade or do much from app. That's unacceptable. The entire point of an app is on the go convenience and quick access to accounts. So it makes you reconsider using Ally for banking if you can't actually do what you need to do. Shopping other online banking options and trading. Update: check out their response. Call to discuss. They got issues if they can't understand the problem already explained. Folks, go elsewhere.",2024-08-16,4
"Starting August 14, 2024 these options are going away. Why? Makes sense to have debit limits set and places where a cards used ""restricted"" to prevent theft.🤯 We're removing some debit card controls, which means you'll no longer be able to set specific restrictions on your debit card, such as transaction amount limits or restricting specific merchant Update: all was removed. Only lock card exist. That an ugly login purple app scheme. Somebody's a big Whoopie Goldberg fan.🟣",2024-08-15,4

"Newest update looks great! Love that you can customize the order of the tasks, that's a nice touch. Mobile deposit works great and overall very pleased with Ally! EDIT Visual update since the one from my original review is a definite step backwards.

The app is very wonky. Not sure what the deal is - never had these issues years ago when I opened my account with Ally. I appreciate the move into an upgraded user experience and a fresh UI but it feels very buggy. 🤷‍♀️,2024-06-17,4
"Honestly, I just opened an account with Ally and haven't used the app yet, but reading what others have said about the updated version, it seems obvious that everyone would be happier if Ally reverted back to the previous version which everyone seemed to be happy with!

It was great until they integrated ally auto with ally banking. Can't even access my auto payments from the banking app.,2024-05-24,4

I donr understand why the app will not let me enter any text into the username or password screen. I've tried uninstalling it and reinstalling it and it still does this.

Not all that. Can't send messages to them. Can't adjust due date or if you are facing hardship u can't make payments. I wish my car was financed elsewhere,2024-05-12,4
"Update - transaction search does not include deposit history. A lot left to be desired compared to a competing back - customer service, competent agents, ease of use in app. The buckets are useless, not current. All major points for this type of bank.

When you log in you start in dark mode, enter your biometric, get a white loading popup, then get a flash of a white screen then back to dark. Then you press on one of your accounts and you're back to light mode. Do it right or not at all.

"I am a little disconcerted to be someone with only an auto loan thru Ally (no banking/no investments) to be shunted onto a new platform at random.

Also why on earth is there a stories button - I'm probably on here for finances not to be launched to your blog.",2024-05-06,4

Horrible experience with payments. Either its not explained well or there system doesn't understand that im trying to make a payment now. I don't know. Either way they charge a ridiculous amount for return fees and considering I already paid but their system applied it as a different payment and not the outstanding payment so I incurred another fee.

This by far is one of the best credit card banking institutions Hands down however this app has issues I have had my primary bank account blocked no fault of my own but because it does not reflect or show that your payment is pending it's as if you never attempted to pay and then if you pay again and the money is not available more than once they block your bank account when is clearly a error on their end for not displaying your payment people who like to pay their bill also want to see it.🫣,2024-05-24,4

Also why so many ads for services and accounts. Maybe make an ""x"" so we can close them out so it's not so cluttered",2025-03-07,4
i kind of wish the withdrawal emails for limited accounts (like Money market with 10 DCH withdrawals monthly) would include which number it was (like you've used 5/10 withdrawals for the month) instead of just when we hit 8. other than that it's an easy app to use and I've been with ally almost 10 years now and am very happy,2025-03-05,4

"I just experienced an incredibly annoying inconvenience with the buckets. I had a lot of my money sorted into them and then multiple transactions went through that I was expecting but they didn't link to my buckets like I hoped they would and so it started a chain reaction of moving money out of other buckets to pay these transactions when if they would have just stayed in my unbucketed spending, I wouldn't have to now fully reorganize amounts into every single bucket.

The UX isn't always great - one thing in particular that bugs me is that if you use a fingerprint to unlock the app and your fingerprint doesn't read correctly, the app (underneath the fingerprint UI) says that services are unavailable.

I have sat on the phone with them for over 3 hours during 5 phone calls in 5 months and still nothing but me being transferred repeatedly. I enjoyed Ally servicing prior to this but this experience is making me question this decision.,2025-05-04,5
I hate the customer service for this company. You're here to help? And then you can't help? The least helpful and customer friendly app and company edit: tell me WHY your password reset security code is so damn slow? here i am WAITING to get a security code and move on with my life but they literally come in too late and then the one I use is incorrect. took way too long just for yall to take my money. make your app more user friendly and accessible and fast. and no I don't want to call anyone,2025-05-04,5
"This app takes FOREVER to load and gives errors a lot. This is not acceptable especially while I'm at the store trying to unlock my card to make a purchase and people are waiting behind me. ALLY, I ASK THAT YOU PLEASE FIX THIS. Thank You.",2025-05-03,5
"using this for a small car payment. Was fine in the first month (currently on month 5), but my gripe is that I can no longer see my payment progress, nor can I see previous history of payments. whenever I click these functions, it crashes or it tells me it cannot complete this function. uninstall/reinstall twice without success. I've called CS (India) as well as email in my issues, but like others have said, it's fallen on deaf ears. will be leaving ASAP.",2025-05-03,5

"Too many annoying bugs. Zelle history doesn't display, account history doesn't display, and half the time finger print login doesn't work which forces me to restart the app. I also don't need to see an unnecessary animation each time I start the app, I just want to see my accounts. They also forcing a Zelle QR code splash screen EVERY single time even after I've declined it every single time. It's ridiculous. Do the engineers test this stuff before release?",2025-05-02,5
"Love the bank, hate the app. It frequently fails to load transactions. Distributing funds in my buckets often blocks out moving money from my unbucketed area even when there is money there to transfer. I have to login in my computer to distribute often. The app often also fails to load my recent transactions.",2025-05-02,5

"This is the glitchiest app ever. It is constantly saying that my banking information is unavailable, and ""they are working on it."" I'm sorry, but this isn't some game, this is my money that I use to run my business! It is a little scary when both the app and the online website are down and I can't access my banking info.

"Cannot login via app or laptop across 3 different browsers. App is broken AGAIN after latest update. Endless issues with the website and the app: freezes, timeouts, error messages, etc., and every update brings new problems.

"Ally has some strange policies that cause unnecessary problems. I recently had fraud on my credit card, but instead of just giving me a new card number, they closed the entire account and opened a new one. This negatively affected my credit score in a way that will take a long time to recover from... for no good reason! The only good thing about Ally is their ""buckets"" feature for savings accounts.",2025-05-01,5

"been using for years and it is getting absolutely insane. you cannot use a VPN to protect your own data when you log in. if your biometrics doesnt catch the VERY FIRST try, you have to completely close the app and again... and again... and too many tries actually locks you out of the entire account. after (if) you log in, they delay a ""notification"" just long enough so that your thumb is over the spam instead of where you actually wanted to tap.",2025-04-22,5

"Ally Bank locks you from accessing your money. The app is terrible at 'switching' the 'to' and 'from' accounts. you think you're sending it in one direction, and then you find out it's going in the other direction. This is the only financial institution app I have ever had such problems. Ally says they don't charge fees, which they don't, but they lock you out of accessing your money. What a terrible company. No one at the call centers are able to answer these questions either.",2025-03-31,5
"Unable to deposit checks via the app - the image capture is not able to capture a satisfactory image no matter what. In addition, the app fails to load/log-in more than 75% of the time - you have to force-quit it to get it to work each time.

"I regularly deposit checks with the bank of America app and it's instant. First check I deposit through the ally app and it's been a week with it being flagged for ""inconsistencies"".

Buggiest App Ever - Constantly have to Force Close and reopen for it to work,2025-03-17,5
I would love to give this a fair rating but I installed the app and tried to create an account. I had type in my SSN and DOB then confirm. Only it tells me something went wrong everytime I attempt it effectively blocking me from creating an account and I am not going to call Ally like it advises just to create an account. That is ridiculous. Fix this!,2025-03-15,5
App has a design flaw where it doesn't work if you have a VPN enabled. You'd think for an online bank they'd put more thought into their customers online security.,2025-03-14,5

The biometrics login on ally still is broken, years later. It works half the time at best. Even when it works, the app is regularly broken, showing ""sorry a maintenance is happening"", but if you restart it then it works (so, not a maintenance). It's also just insanely slow. Zelle also slow",2025-03-07,5

Finally cancelled my account. Good riddance. I highly suggest doing this on a computer because you can't see what you are typing on the app. It made things far more cumbersome than they needed to be. I only used this account as a fun money one so it wasn't much of a loss.,2025-02-27,5

You'll get more than 1 stars when your app lets me transfer between invest accounts. Utterly useless. Edit: this review was posted after I called them and they couldn't help.

Ally Credit card has by far the worst customer service! My account was flagged for fraud and they required documents to be faxed..

This has nothing to do with that app. This company and it's employees are not on the same page. I don't know if it's training or lack of communication. Customer service has has given us 3 different answers when it comes explaining the lease turn in process. Which was also different from what the dealer expected was going to happen. My advice to anyone who already using this company is to bypass regular agents and ask for manager directly. They seem to be the only ones who have a grasp on policy.,2025-01-08,5

Allys app used to have push notifications for debit card transactions. I contacted support and this option is no longer available and you can only choose text or email. Problem with that is those notifications often come delayed (24-48 hours after the transaction occurred). My other banks still use push notifications so I don't understand why Ally removed this.

the bank is great. 💯 the concept of the buckets is great. but there are sooo many bugs and issues with the App.. (and the website tbh) there are some buckets i am -never- able to look at the transactions for. sometimes I have to close and restart the app when I'm moving money around because it runs into errors. i run into fewer issues on the website but recently it seems that they are just as bad as each other but in different ways so I end up having both open to get my weekly stuff down 🤦,2025-05-09,5

It does a good job of auto-imaging and interpreting checks; it only rarely asks for a re-do (usually this happens with official state of California checks, which it has trouble reading). I wish that remote deposits were available on the home screen rather than from the menu. Otherwise the app handles my needs pretty well.",2025-03-31,5

i kind of wish the withdrawal emails for limited accounts (like Money market with 10 DCH withdrawals monthly) would include which number it was (like you've used 5/10 withdrawals for the month) instead of just when we hit 8. other than that it's an easy app to use and I've been with ally almost 10 years now and am very happy,2025-03-05,5
