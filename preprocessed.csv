Worse than useless. TD Bank has horrible software engineers who can't figure out how to make final automatic payments that were agreed to in writing at the time of the loan. The qpp shows the wrong payoff amount allowing TD to charge extra interest. App changes and payments take up to two weeks to shoe..even for just an address change. This delay allows TD to claim they sent out a notice that they unilaterally changed payment process .
