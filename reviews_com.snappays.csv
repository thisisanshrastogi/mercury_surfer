Confusing appt.but I think I have gotten it done,2024-03-05,3
clearly a scam. it rejected my legitimate name in the name field and rejected my legitimate routing number in one of the two routing number fields. so now they have all my bank information. I contacted them and they refused to accept that their app was failing. this is an overseas company who is not beholden to U.S. law.,2025-05-14,4
"I loved this service until this week. They charged my bank account $39 for a privacy service that I did not authorize. They are racking up complaints right and left, with the BBB and others for this underhanded activity. I will be having my account with them expunged. Stay away from them!",2025-05-13,4
"It didn't work for me. Took forever, and every few days, I'll get an email requesting more info. Once provided, it'll go back to processing and repeating the info request. Canceled the payment and went the traditional way.",2025-04-28,4

Absolutely Pointless,2025-03-08,4
"I installed this to pay some medical bills because it was recommended by the biller's website. Every payment, no matter what form of payment has the same result, a text that said ""payment cannot be made"" - meanwhile they have ads on the app as well. I called my credit card company and they said they had no record of my card being declined. Awful experience all around. Now I'm going to have to call someone on the phone or write a check.",2025-03-06,4

"This company took $1000.00 dollars from my account without my permission. I called customer service, and the man told me that any time a bill came, they would just take your money. Never again, will I ever use this app, and when you research it, people are saying the same thing",2025-01-22,4
Don't waste your time the app doesn't save anything you have to add it 5 times and there's more I wanna say but I won't,2025-01-22,4
"It doesn't save my form of payments ,bank, or credit card details. When I choose a bill to pay,it will not show the payment I saved. Doesn't accept visa cards either.",2025-01-18,4

"I would give 0 stars if possible. Paid my bill, but they asked for the picture again. Because I didn't download the app previously, no way to link the new picture with the previous payment. Help desk not helpful. Needed to cancel charges through CC company. TERRIBLE app. Might have been better if I downloaded the app when I took the first picture, but I hate when companies force me to download an app. Will just pay over phone from now on. Awful service.",2024-07-26,4
Scammer Alert!!! Do Not Use This App!!! It's a scam. I submitted & resubmitted my bills. Different customer service reps kept asking for the same information over & over again. I received emails that kept saying they're checking my info & allow a few business days to process. I noticed this Papaya company tried to debit money out of my account for the bill they're supposedly paying. I thought this company paid bills for customers & customers pay them back in installments. They Don't! They Scam!,2024-07-16,4
I downloaded my bill at 2 days ago but when are you going to pay UPDATE: DO NOT USE THIS APP! I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT THEY PAY THE BILL FOR YOU AND YOU PAY THEM BACK IN INSTALLMENTS FOR EXAMPLE LIKE BACK BY WEEKLY OR MONTHLY. I THOUGHT THEY WORKED LIKE DEFFERIT. THEY TOOK $277 OUT OF MY ACCOUNT WHICH OTHER BILLS WERE COMING OUT OF THAT ACCOUNT AND NOW I HAVE TO WAIT THREE TO FIVE BUSINESS DAYS. I'M JUST SO TIRED OF THESE FRAUDULENT COMPANIES COMING OUT WITH APPS THAT DO NOT WORK FOR US!,2024-07-03,4
At first I thought this was a cool app but then they took my credit card information said it was in transfer for weeks then all of sudden my account goes too fraud and I get kicked out my account can't even log back in now I'm wondering who got my card information and what was in transfer and where my money that got tooking out mane leave these apps alone you don't wanna screw your self over smh,2024-06-29,4
"Do not pay with this!!! They withdrew the money from my account and the payee never received the payment. I contacted the payee because the withdraw was on my account and the payee said to check the papaya app for a confirmation number. Papaya says my payment was declined but my bank statement shows otherwise. BE SMART, CALL AND MAKE A PAYMENT TO THE PAYEE!!!!",2024-06-04,4
Just Didn't Work,2024-05-17,4
"Never works right, refuse to use again. My experience has included being double charged which took forever to resolve and payments not going through to provider despite confirmation. Also hate they make you download an app and then it doesn't work right ever. I will write and mail a check rather than use Papaya again.",2024-05-17,4

no due balance is presented in app. users are required to capture an image of the bill and then type the amount they wish to pay. no OCR occurs on the image captured so it's unclear why this is even a necessary step.,2024-04-16,4
becareful guys - please give me refund for subscription.,2024-04-14,4

This app deserve a zero star. They will not reply or contact you even you complain to them how many times. There is no way you can refund your money back. Very Disappointed here.,2024-04-05,4
"If you make payments on a bill, it does not show your payment or remaining balance. You have no way of knowing if your payment is going where it is supposed to. I don't understand why billers need a shady middle man and not be paid directly. Update: I got another notice from papaya for a bill. Even though I've paid over half, the notice I got shows I still owe the full amount. Not at all surprised.",2024-04-01,4

Company just took my money and won't give back. I payed a bill through this company and they were not able to pay them. They ended up canceling the order and I havent gotten my money back that was deposited into their account. They use the excuse that they can't help but to contact my bank? Stay away from using them! Update: this company gives no assurances except communicate with the bank when I had problems due to my bank account was closed. No other options. What a headache!,2024-03-09,4
"Read the BBB complaints. Wanted to pay a medical bill, so I thought I might give it a try. Downloaded and installed and became concerned with lack of explanation as to how it works, fees, timing, etc. Just snap a pic of your bill to get started! I decided to explore reviews other than google's before proceeding. I'm glad I did. I uninstalled it before using. Beware.",2024-02-15,4
This form of payment sucks. Tried 3 times so far. I hope you go bankrupt,2024-01-23,4
Cumbersome interface and an annoying clickthrough page for an add-on service. Annoyed my healthcare provider has this app as the only online payment method. Next time I'll just drive a few miles to pay in person.,2024-01-15,4

"Awkward at best, surely unusable for some. I had to trick the app into letting me enter my phone number and email. The bill recognition is cool, but when basic data entry fails there is work that needs to be done.

"Except for a couple of glitches like my font is set slightly larger than is common & it appeared to cut off the tops of the numbers when I entered my credit card info (making a ""7"" appear to be a ""1"") - quite confusing until I figured that out! then it wouldn't accept the address it scanned from my bill because it had the 4- digit extension in the ZIP code field. Once I got the l those few things taken care of the app WORKS GREAT!!",2024-11-10,4
