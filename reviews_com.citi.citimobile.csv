App still won't load statements and now I can't even make a payment.,2025-05-23,1
I'm really not impressed at all by citibank from the moment I got approved for the credit card I had issues with suspicious activity before the card was even activated. Now a few years later for no reason my account has been like reset and I have to re link my personal loan account and re add my payment method as well as re register my card. I would not recommend citibank.,2025-05-23,1
Before y'all decide to do business with these ripoffs go read the reviews and also check how many law suits they have against them. BAD HORRIBLE and definitely DISHONEST,2025-05-22,1
"The app needs some serious work everytime you log into it bugs out and won't load anything making it a real pain to do anything with your account, it will make you not want to bank with them that's how bad this app is.",2025-05-22,1
not good!,2025-05-22,1
By far the clunkiest and buggiest major credit card app. It times out constantly and has consistent periods where nothing will load.,2025-05-22,1
"Might as well drive down to the bank this app sucks. Can never check my statement. The app consistently has trouble loading, if it loads at all.",2025-05-21,1
"Fix biometrics. Yes I tried reinstalling/updating, no the issue keeps coming back.",2025-05-21,1
cannot use,2025-05-21,1
ripp off!!,2025-05-21,1
"nothing ever loads, loading screen for every option and it never gets past loading screen. random logout while in the middle of looking at information on the app and upon logging in it gets stuck on loading screen having user force close just to try again and hope it works correct",2025-05-20,1
Absolute worst company out there. Over a year and they still cannot fix their online payments!!! Now they Are refusing to take a payment over the phone. I suggest any other company besides this one. Complete nightmare to deal with,2025-05-20,1
l hate updates. I'm in a hurry and l have to go through this,2025-05-19,1
"Update. Impossible to use this ""fng"" app. Garbage. App is tricky on sign in but overall very easy to use.",2025-05-19,1
can't use on my android phone,2025-05-19,1
Will not login! Just keeps loading!,2025-05-19,1
"The app broke and caused me to miss a payment. When I select the option to pay, it just shows the loading icon forever. When I try to contact support with the app, it does the same thing. It's been over a week and it still doesn't work. I was eventually able to pay using the mobile website, but it was acting strange as well (it let me log in with just my password and no user ID).",2025-05-19,1
"the fact that I need 2 different sets of credentials to use my personal and business accounts, and I can't link them somehow like every other credit card is very inconvenient.",2025-05-18,1
SUCKS!!!,2025-05-18,1
crashes everytime I put in my password,2025-05-18,1
"Less than useless. Will not accept any current password at any point, regardless of whether last reset via web, app, or phone.",2025-05-18,1
"this is the worst bank you can deposit your money in, I don't recommend it to anyone.",2025-05-18,1
"Citi doesn't credit me with merchant offers.. MISLEADING. CUSTOMER SERVICE AND DISPUTES ARE HORRIBLE. IF YOU DO GET SOMEONE ON THE PHONE WITH SOMETHING YOU CAN'T RESOLVE ON THE WEBSITE, YOU END UP TALKING TO SOMEBODY INCOMPETENT IN INDIA",2025-05-18,1
the app never let's you log in to pay can see account can see what's on card and what's due but app crashes everything and never let's you enter pen to pay your bill,2025-05-18,1
"my purse was stolen in February. I called the credit bureau and had all my accounts frozen. I could not and Did NOT make any purchases in over 3 months. I asked for a new card with a new # and got a card with fraudulent charges on it. Reported the fraud the 1st week of May. Asked for a new card. Was told a new card would be sent, still nothing. Now more charges!!!?",2025-05-17,1
"Still unusable, the worst customer service on the planet. Wants me to email them. How about this, why don't you just fix the app? Duh!",2025-05-17,1
"my rating is for the customer service not the app, because there is no obvious way to provide feedback for their service. because the reps are not held accountable, I assume this behavior just carries on. I called to ask questions about a flex plan. The rep couldn't answer my questions and after putting me on hold several times for several minutes, she pretended she couldn't hear me and screamed over and over ""because I lost our connection I will end this call now"". My connection was perfect",2025-05-17,1
"I go to make a payment and it just gets to an endless loading screen. Terrible, terrible app. And considering this affects the ability to actually make a payment and could induce late fees or interest fees, I sense this could become an actual legal issue.",2025-05-17,1
terrible large bank with outdated policies and foreign customer service,2025-05-17,1
"Do NOT do business with these people. I've got 20 years as a loyal customer, no missed payments no issues whatsoever and tens of thousands of dollars in transactions. I have $90 worth of fraud hit my account and immediately report. They side with the scammers and say I have to pay the charges. F U Citi... card destroyed, will never do business again!!",2025-05-16,1
when you click on make a payment the app hangs and you have to close amd restart it,2025-05-16,1
"My experience with your customer service representative today was very frustrating as I experienced extreme difficulty in understanding her... I believe she is sending me a copy of my April statement which I not yet received... I received my May statement today... and still have issues with recurring charges, which are fraudulent and unresolved by Citi... I will be in contact with your fraud department again once I receive my April statement..",2025-05-15,1
"Unable to sign in. No matter how many times I attempt to change User ID or password, it always fails. Good thing I have email reminders and can get in that way or I'd be sunk!",2025-05-15,1

The app freezes when loading or refreshing a new page.,2025-05-15,1
If you have any issues their customer service will juggle you like a clown. They dont care about loyal customers and they have the highest APR out of all my cards and have always refused to come down even if you plead with them. Theyll only help you if you stop paying so apperantly thats in your best interest if you need help from them and want them to notice.,2025-05-15,1
"it was good until they closed my account for 1 bounced payment, no warnings no retry, just closed it.",2025-05-14,1
terrible,2025-05-14,1

Never works since update. biometrics doesn't work and crashes my phone,2025-05-14,1
"Paid off the balance. Then, they lowered the available credit by 6000 dollars. Why? Bad faith business. Do not use. They called me to say they sent me a letter. Who cares? How does that help? Refused to help. Do not pay off a Citibank card. edit: they set up a phone appointment. on the phone call, all they would say is that they sent me a letter. waste of time.",2025-05-14,1
"I don't want to chat with AI. No understanding of my questions. When asked for live agent, no better help. Typing to respond, I get pop up I'm taking long with no interaction. There's no consideration for seniors or those who don't use technology much. Everyone is trying to force technology on people with no consideration. Everything is becoming dehumanized. Companies only care about money and not customer service or helping anymore. I'm trying to pay off all my credit cards and not have any.",2025-05-13,1
why do you need my cking account and password?,2025-05-13,1

"WARNING !!! : I thought I would start a Citibank account to see how they would be. I deposited my first deposit, they somehow flagged the deposit as a scam and shut down the whole account with no explanation also voiding the check I deposited. The whole thing was a disaster from start to finish. do yourself a favor and stay with Capital One. edit: They shut my account then put the check in anyway and now I have to wait 30 to 60 days to get my money. read the reviews guys.",2025-05-12,1
Not sure yet,2025-05-12,1
cannot login on OPPO Reno12 F 5G colorOS 14.0. used to work great but is not working anymore. after I put credentials on login screen it restarts the application and goes back to screen. I deleted cache and app 3 times and installed it again but it's a consistent bug issue with after logging in.,2025-05-12,1
"terrible they decrease your limit out of the blue affecting my credit score negatively, I will never get another Citi card again, no other credit card company has done this to me",2025-05-11,1
Dunno why these apps feel the need to change the view layout of these apps. I have to scroll down now to pay my bill instead of just swiftly burning through the next buttons. You're not making anything better by adding steps. Obviously bots ramp up the score on these. Just read em. every single day has to reverify device. bs,2025-05-11,1
Horrible. Skips the log in and went straight to my card information.,2025-05-11,1

Citi somehow manages to always provide the worst customer experience in the USA. They haven't failed to utterly disappoint me even once. congrats,2025-05-09,1
card payment doesn't work. keeps on loading forever. very annoying when you're trying to submit a payment before due date.,2025-05-09,1
"The Flex Spend plan is worthless, unless you like accumulating a balance on your Standard APR while they pay down more than the monthly principal on your Flex plan. Yes, they're ""just following the law"" which states that the highest interest balance must be paid first, so your recent purchases have to go past the grace period and you get hit with that interest before you can apply payment to it. Everything about banks is bull s#!t.",2025-05-09,1
not good,2025-05-09,1
"I hate this app solely because when I am waiting to chat with a human, the app keeps sending me notifications that there's a new message for me, except the new message is that I'm still in line waiting for a human. Then the chat will randomly, so when I restart the chat to speak with a person I'm at the back of the line. An absolutely terrible user experience.",2025-05-09,1

"Update: Finally deleted mobile app. Repeatedly experiencing endless buffering when I need to make a payment. Now resorting to using desktop version. It works well when it works but now and then, it will buffer endlessly and it's oddly when I'm trying to schedule payment. Update 1/4/25: Citibank is SUPER FAST responding but....I am back to seeing the endless buffering even after following their fix-it suggestions. And again, it's while I'm trying to make payment.",2025-05-07,1
It has crash on me a few times but all in all i love the citi app far better than the capital one app. I love that my costco rewards are viewable as well. edit: 05/07/25 - app still takes absolutely forever to load. when will they give an update to fix this. its getting to the point im having trouble paying my bill.,2025-05-07,1

Citi Bank is a great bank. The tellers are always so helpful and polite. Even on the phone with the same help. Been banking for 2 years almost 3 . I would not change banks. My money is secure. Thanks Citi Bank,2025-05-06,1
Had always been reliable up to the last month or so... Continuously Hangs up and wont do anything. Now in order to get to the travel booking site you have to go back into this trainwreck to get let in. Hopefully there is an update on the horizon 🙏,2025-05-05,1
I've had nothing but problems with Citi and this app. I can't make a payment to do anything with it but yet one day late they send me an old they send me a charge like $38 something like that because I was one day late then I could make a payment and you can't get ahold of these people.,2025-05-05,1

"citibank is by far the worst bank you can trust with your money. They have the WORST customer service I've ever encountered. Citibank froze all my accounts and gave me the biggest run around and have yet to explain to me what I did wrong they held my money for weeks putting me behind on rent, bills and even having to borrow money to feed my kids as I found out my accounts where on hold while grocery shopping. I figured I can go into a branch and close and they declined to do so. Horrible!",2025-04-30,1

Not user friendly,2025-04-29,1
"I'm extremely dissatisfied with customer service and support. I received no reminders for my upcoming payment, Ironically, they efficiently reported the missed payment to the credit bureau. It's frustrating to see penalties prioritized over customer support. Until they address these issues, I advise caution and recommend exploring alternative options that prioritize customer satisfaction. One star from me.",2025-04-29,1
Sucks!!! It doesn't allow me to give additional payments probably to charge me the interest!! It's so frustrating!!,2025-04-29,1

Do yourself a favor an get better cards.",2025-04-28,1
"Citibank app frustrates me as a frequent traveler and Amazon shopper. Pending transactions deduct instantly, but credits from hotel stays and returns aren't made available right away. Instead, Citibank waits until my account goes negative before applying credits, making me pay twice. Returns come back in small portions rather than full amounts. I'm still waiting on $800+ in credits for weeks. Now I transfer any credit to another bank immediately to avoid Citibank's double-dipping. Avoid this app",2025-04-27,1
good,2025-04-27,1
doesn't work!!!!!,2025-04-27,1
"Using this app blocked all access to my Citi account. I've spoken with nearly 30 Citi reps in the past 3 days, most who can't even speak English, and not one of them has solved my issue. I can't login to pay my bill, and this is going to destroy my credit rating. I am using the remaining balance of my account to hire an attorney to sue them. Avoid this app and Citi at all costs! You've been warned. EDIT: See below, Citi responded and they handle financial issues through X and Facebook. Avoid!",2025-04-26,1
I highly do not recommend. Citi Bank is a terrible company that I have closed my account and will never be do business with again. There are many more better options than Citi Bank!,2025-04-26,1
There's no point of contact like email or something for people overseas. I'm unable to log in nor reach out to anyone through email. No email to reply to its all non monitored. How come it's a one-way communication between me and the bank?! There's no live chat and can't find it anywhere.,2025-04-26,1
they changed your available balance way to often. I have had both increase and large decrease in credit as soon as I paid it to half way paid off they reduced to balance. I paid almost all the balance and they increased. then reduced. it's to unstable,2025-04-26,1

I was using the app for over a year with no problems then I was cleaning up my phone and using the Samsung tool to uninstall and delete unwanted/unused items and apps and for some reason it included the Citibank app. When I went to download it again from the store it says my phone is not compatible with the app even though I was using it prior to the uninstall. absolutely ridiculous!,2025-04-18,1

this application is horrendous. it's costing me money because of the problems I've encountered. I added my savings to make a payment. made the payment and then it pulled from my checking. due to the issues in the application it's cost me 130$ because it won't stop. citi refuses to help as well. citi is still refusing to refund my money due to their warranty program.

Once you use your card a lot. They lower your credit limit which I don't understand because I've paid my bill on time every time. But use it a lot and because I use it a lot. Say have lower my limit. Why give credit limits for us to use? And then we use them and you know with them!,2025-04-15,1

The biometrics don't work. In fact it just doesn't show up anymore as an option when I launch the app even though I have it turned on in the settings. The customer support number for online banking just wants to read off my account balance and is useless in trying to solve this issue.,2025-04-14,1

I really don't like that it makes you update the pin every time biometrics changes. Once in a while I need to re-enroll a fingerprint and biometrics login just straight up doesn't work anymore with no indication why or how to fix it.

When I tried from the app, it doesn't list my past recipients like the website does. No problem I will just re-enter the information.

Tried help line, fail again",2025-02-03,2

Once you use your card a lot. They lower your credit limit which I don't understand because I've paid my bill on time every time. But use it a lot and because I use it a lot. Say have lower my limit. Why give credit limits for us to use? And then we use them and you know with them!,2025-04-15,3

Please make sure your app is safe and wasn't hacked yesterday.,2025-04-15,3

The biometrics don't work. In fact it just doesn't show up anymore as an option when I launch the app even though I have it turned on in the settings. The customer support number for online banking just wants to read off my account balance and is useless in trying to solve this issue.,2025-04-14,3

I really don't like that it makes you update the pin every time biometrics changes.

be careful in the app if you try to request a replacement card for whatever reason it will end your account number. send a new card out in several days and you will not have access to a card until it arrives in the mail. you should know this because you don't get a warning in the app that tells you that it's about to close the old number out. and ask again if you really want to do this. always phone a customer service rep when it comes to some of the services offered through the app.,2025-03-29,3

May be simply under stated income during account update as card was never above 22% of limit before reduction and now over 94% with reduced limit! Found that being issued a Costco Visa (also Citi Bank) had the unfortunate effect of reduction and shorting limit!,2025-02-08,3
Workable,2025-02-08,3
"App and customer service is bad. Balance transfer issue, it has been two days now trying to use the live chat. Don't know if it's intentional but the app keeps disconnecting you and then when you try to resume it always asks to be logged back in. Doesn't even go back to the previous conversation unless you finesse the app a bit. Sometimes it just ends the chat completely and your stuck back to square one. Last conversation seemed like it was intentional, wouldn't even let me log back in..",2025-02-07,3

I had a transaction go thru without notification. Now I lost $504.00 taken from my account. If I had been notified I would've blocked it and would've prevented it. Now I cannot get the money back,2025-01-28,3

Seems to be a great app . Easy to use other than when you are trying to see if you qualify for a loan it gives you a place to fill out but after filling in the blank it says they will mail you a reason .....seems to be the only bad part I mean if u want to get a loan u would think it would be easier,2025-01-22,3
It is ok. I don't like it!,2025-01-22,3

"The ability to see account balance without logging in is convenient until I need to do something that requires logging in... then the auth process just spins and fails until I get frustrated and force quit the app. I then have to reopen it and immediately choose to login before I accidentally click on something that will require auth.

I'm really not impressed at all by citibank from the moment I got approved for the credit card I had issues with suspicious activity before the card was even activated. Now a few years later for no reason my account has been like reset and I have to re link my personal loan account and re add my payment method as well as re register my card. I would not recommend citibank.,2025-05-23,4

"my rating is for the customer service not the app, because there is no obvious way to provide feedback for their service. because the reps are not held accountable, I assume this behavior just carries on.

If you have any issues their customer service will juggle you like a clown.

The app crashes a lot.,2025-04-20,4
The biometric sign on never works. No matter how many times I hit the fingerprint scanner button it never loads just acts like it tried than nothing. Yet they want to advertise and says it's the most secure way to log in. How does an option that doesn't work become the most secured method?,2025-04-18,4
I can't add my current bank to the payment,2025-04-18,4
why its freezing all the time. ever since I enable the Barcelona view to show right away. then I select something I would assume I then have to log in. but it just freezes. cant even select sign on. I have to keep closing and refreshing. very annoying,2025-04-16,4
Edit: I don't know if it was an update or what but for at least the last 6 Plus months I have to close the app anywhere from 5 to 10 times for it to actually let me sign in otherwise it just continually loads.. Not as good as amex app or at least I'm just not seeing similar features but it gets the job done!,2025-04-15,4
I really don't like that it makes you update the pin every time biometrics changes. Once in a while I need to re-enroll a fingerprint and biometrics login just straight up doesn't work anymore with no indication why or how to fix it. You need to delete the whole security profile and re-enroll which forces a pin update. At this point I lock myself out constantly since I went through so many pins I don't remember which one to use. No other banking app is this annoying.,2025-04-15,4
Very difficult to register. Did wrong app. Can't find icon on phone. Not my first app install BTW.,2025-04-14,4

be careful in the app if you try to request a replacement card for whatever reason it will end your account number. send a new card out in several days and you will not have access to a card until it arrives in the mail. you should know this because you don't get a warning in the app that tells you that it's about to close the old number out. and ask again if you really want to do this. always phone a customer service rep when it comes to some of the services offered through the app.,2025-03-29,4

This app is very busy with an overload of information.,2025-03-13,4
It is a bit confusing,2025-03-13,4
"Citibank was the best in costumer service, now you charge for all.",2025-03-11,4
"I was disappointed today that I had a look up my password because the biometrics was not working. Hopefully, this is just a one-time error.",2025-03-11,4
It's ok for a bank app,2025-03-11,4
"Can't add my card to my mobile wallet. Called in, waited 20 minutes on hold off with my call transferred, then was hung up on after a weird call with the fraud department that was supposed to verify my identity and allow the card to be added to my mobile wallet.",2025-03-11,4
I use it because i have too. But it is easy to navigate.,2025-03-10,4
I'd give it five star if they add virtual credit numbers to Android version (they did it for iPhone).,2025-03-10,4
Sign in is not user-friendly,2025-03-10,4
I already paid a couple of weeks ago & now it's telling me I still have a balance to clear!,2025-03-09,4
"Biometric login completely broken, making using the app frustrating",2025-03-09,4
"Easy to use, easy to find the info you're looking for... but trying to reset your password is an absolute nightmare 😫",2025-03-09,4
This Citi Bank App wasn't user friendly for YEARS!!! It's gotten been over time and very well it should have.,2025-03-07,4
Sometimes the app works and other times not so much,2025-03-07,4
Sometimes I have a hard time logging in,2025-03-06,4
Unable to navigate to any menu items. Stuck processing.,2025-03-05,4
Bad experience with dead old cell phone numbers should be option for email verification also.,2025-03-04,4
A little excessive to change password,2025-03-03,4
Too slow with issues,2025-03-03,4
Fine,2025-03-02,4
"Biometric and pin number login don't work, so my rating is based on the extra hassle it takes to login compared to other accounts.",2025-03-02,4
"Can't sign on, infinitely loads.",2025-03-02,4
Too much I fo to put on internet,2025-03-01,4
Very difficult to set up,2025-03-01,4
"App does what its supposed to do when working, and i really appreciated the biometric login and ease of use for accessing features found on some of my cards. Recently got an S25 Ultra and it is now stating the device is rooted, even though its using stock software from my cellular service provider. Rating only 3 stars until it gets fixed.",2025-02-28,4
Takes a long time to sign on,2025-02-27,4
Not as intuitive as other banking apps.,2025-02-27,4
Biometric login not working. I have to 2 factor authenticate both the app and the website every single time I try to log in but yet they can't seem to figure out how to add text as an option so I have to get a phone call every time and it takes forever to log on!,2025-02-27,4
Meh...,2025-02-27,4
"-1 star for not being able to manage zelle payees, otherwise it's good, however they have changed to ""simplified banking"" which means they now simply steal money from your account.",2025-02-26,4
User friendly on most stuff,2025-02-26,4
"Someone confusing, too much information in too small of a space",2025-02-25,4
"It's good, if can notify me with the credit card expense and bank account changes, I would appreciate it.",2025-02-22,4
Very convenient. Please restore my snapshot. I cannot access it now.,2025-02-22,4
"The app logs me in directly when I open it. I am not required to complete security checks. It allows me to navigate my cards. As soon as I need to do anything sensitive - access payments, transaction searches - the app hangs for 2-3 minutes before going to my preferred sign on security screen (6-digit PIN). The app does the same thing if I hit ""sign on"", only this time, I receive additional sign on options (pin, password or QR code). Selecting a different option does not shorten the wait time.",2025-02-21,4
Would like to see more on charges. Confusing as what is negative and positive.,2025-02-21,4
Latest update seems to have broken logins. It just spins when I click on login with PIN. What happened to biometric login?,2025-02-21,4
"App now says no connectivity. Restarted phone , check updates on wifi and mobile data. Something happened.",2025-02-21,4
"Since I became a member, I had the unfortunate experience of not receiving my promotional gift 😪💔",2025-02-20,4
The app has some glitches,2025-02-20,4
App is just okay. Not the smoothest experience but not the worst either. Edit: App completely stopped working after recent updates starting mid-August. I have tried reinstalling but it just gets stuck on the Citi splash screen. I can't believe it takes them this long to rollback to a working version. Edit: App has been fixed a month later.,2025-02-20,4
Biometric login isn't working. Neither is the PIN. Still nothing in the support page to report problems.,2025-02-20,4
The sys tem was down on Tuesday morning around 8:30am. (Est) time. I was not able to use my card to pay for parking.,2025-02-20,4
Can be more user friendly.,2025-02-19,4
"good, does what it's supposed to do",2025-02-19,4
Some options are hard to find,2025-02-17,4
It's difficult to find how you can deposit your check or sign off.,2025-02-15,4
It works - Does what it says in the tin,2025-02-15,4
"Overall it is a good app, easy to use. I would love if it tells you when your promotional APR will end and they need to explain better the rewards. If they fix this I will change the review to 5 stars",2025-02-15,4
Balance amounts before and after balance payments are confusing.,2025-02-14,4
"App had been perfect until the last 2 months--it no longer allows me to make a payment. (!) The ""loading circle of death"" spins forever, the ""Back"" button is unable to stop it/do anything. Otherwise, it's a great app.",2025-02-14,4
"I can't update your app, why?",2025-02-14,4
"The app is good, but very slow when opening or trying to make payments. I get the spinning wheel forever.",2025-02-14,4
Frequently hangs when trying to make a payment. Not convenient for this.... Using an S22 Ultra.,2025-02-13,4
Easy to use!,2025-02-12,4
Okay,2025-02-12,4
"When I open the app with my password, the message says they will send me a temporary password to open my account as a security measure. However, I find that all I have to do is click on continue and I don't need the password. My information just shows up. This isn't very good security.",2025-02-11,4
Unable to log on using biometrics since changing phones to S24+. I have created new fingerprints in biometrics but the app doesn't recognize any.,2025-02-10,4
"I like the app, but even though it states one can use fingerprint entry, there is no way to allow you in the app to do so.",2025-02-10,4
Need to show previous and all transactions and payment history,2025-02-10,4
"Does what you need, but still too many ads/offers to trap you into more debt.",2025-02-09,4
Biometric logon no longer works. No excuse for this...,2025-02-08,4
Overall good experiences with app and site! I do have to see why massive drop in available credit occured. Available credit reduction caused a drop in credit score which is something I watch like a Hawk and protect! May be simply under stated income during account update as card was never above 22% of limit before reduction and now over 94% with reduced limit! Found that being issued a Costco Visa (also Citi Bank) had the unfortunate effect of reduction and shorting limit!,2025-02-08,4
Workable,2025-02-08,4
"App and customer service is bad. Balance transfer issue, it has been two days now trying to use the live chat. Don't know if it's intentional but the app keeps disconnecting you and then when you try to resume it always asks to be logged back in. Doesn't even go back to the previous conversation unless you finesse the app a bit. Sometimes it just ends the chat completely and your stuck back to square one. Last conversation seemed like it was intentional, wouldn't even let me log back in..",2025-02-07,4
Works well when I need it,2025-02-06,4
"Fast, simple, available .",2025-02-06,4
Can't find details of my Costco bill,2025-02-06,4
The app doesn't fit well on my screen,2025-02-06,4
It always takes a long time to load,2025-02-05,4
I posted a few payment and my history of payment was flawless until mistakenly I skip one I didn't received any reminder,2025-02-05,4
Did not open easily,2025-02-05,4
So far so good,2025-02-05,4
I would like to see a running balance after each transaction. Thanks,2025-02-03,4
Better than the web version.,2025-02-02,4
Thank you for protecting my card. Charged not authorized.,2025-02-02,4
I wish I could see an itemized list of the things that got bought,2025-02-01,4
Difficult. But agent was very helpful and professional. Thank You.,2025-01-30,4
"Good service, rate is too high.",2025-01-29,4
I had a transaction go thru without notification. Now I lost $504.00 taken from my account. If I had been notified I would've blocked it and would've prevented it. Now I cannot get the money back,2025-01-28,4
I just wanted to get into my account.,2025-01-28,4
I especially like a 6 digital code instead of a password.,2025-01-28,4
Not very good.,2025-01-28,4
all good except the pop up ads make you feel unimportant,2025-01-27,4
Wish both users on the account could see all charges,2025-01-25,4
"I like the app but have a hard time merging my bank for payments, so I have to process my payments over the phone.",2025-01-24,4
Suddenly removed some of my payment options (banks) exactly when I wanted to make a payment through it. Desktop version shows all banks.,2025-01-24,4
alot to learn,2025-01-23,4
"It's what is available. Frankly speaking, in doing any kind of transaction, this app is filled with too many levels of ""attaining that final level of completion"". There is just too much minutia to wade through. You can simplify the process without these needless complications.",2025-01-23,4
Seems to be a great app . Easy to use other than when you are trying to see if you qualify for a loan it gives you a place to fill out but after filling in the blank it says they will mail you a reason .....seems to be the only bad part I mean if u want to get a loan u would think it would be easier,2025-01-22,4
It is ok. I don't like it!,2025-01-22,4
Will continuously load when trying to make a payment. Usually have to use the website version to pay. Should fix bug.,2025-01-22,4
I really like the paper information mailed to me.,2025-01-21,4
Wish u change the fee to $200 not $1000 to hold the account.. I would rate higher if this was changed..,2025-01-20,4
"The ability to see account balance without logging in is convenient until I need to do something that requires logging in... then the auth process just spins and fails until I get frustrated and force quit the app. I then have to reopen it and immediately choose to login before I accidentally click on something that will require auth. This has existed over multiple versions, how did your UAT testing fail to catch this? Otherwise it's been a solid app, but this feature is just a waste of time.",2025-01-19,4
Works well.,2025-05-24,4

"Excellent banking app. Not the most aesthetically pleasing banking app I've used so far, but definitely not bad.

I would not recommend citibank.,2025-05-23,5
Before y'all decide to do business with these ripoffs go read the reviews and also check how many law suits they have against them. BAD HORRIBLE and definitely DISHONEST,2025-05-22,5

If you have any issues their customer service will juggle you like a clown.

"The Flex Spend plan is worthless, unless you like accumulating a balance on your Standard APR while they pay down more than the monthly principal on your Flex plan.

Instead, Citibank waits until my account goes negative before applying credits, making me pay twice. Returns come back in small portions rather than full amounts. I'm still waiting on $800+ in credits for weeks. Now I transfer any credit to another bank immediately to avoid Citibank's double-dipping. Avoid this app",2025-04-27,5

I really don't like that it makes you update the pin every time biometrics changes. Once in a while I need to re-enroll a fingerprint and biometrics login just straight up doesn't work anymore with no indication why or how to fix it. You need to delete the whole security profile and re-enroll which forces a pin update. At this point I lock myself out constantly since I went through so many pins I don't remember which one to use. No other banking app is this annoying.,2025-04-15,5

be careful in the app if you try to request a replacement card for whatever reason it will end your account number. send a new card out in several days and you will not have access to a card until it arrives in the mail. you should know this because you don't get a warning in the app that tells you that it's about to close the old number out. and ask again if you really want to do this. always phone a customer service rep when it comes to some of the services offered through the app.,2025-03-29,5

Overall good experiences with app and site! I do have to see why massive drop in available credit occured. Available credit reduction caused a drop in credit score which is something I watch like a Hawk and protect! May be simply under stated income during account update as card was never above 22% of limit before reduction and now over 94% with reduced limit! Found that being issued a Costco Visa (also Citi Bank) had the unfortunate effect of reduction and shorting limit!,2025-02-08,5
Workable,2025-02-08,5
"App and customer service is bad. Balance transfer issue, it has been two days now trying to use the live chat. Don't know if it's intentional but the app keeps disconnecting you and then when you try to resume it always asks to be logged back in.

Seems to be a great app .

"The ability to see account balance without logging in is convenient until I need to do something that requires logging in... then the auth process just spins and fails until I get frustrated and force quit the app. I then have to reopen it and immediately choose to login before I accidentally click on something that will require auth.
