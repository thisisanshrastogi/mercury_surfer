App quit working after the last update,2025-05-24,1
Since latest update I can't open the app unless I restart my phone each time. It gives a continuous loading signal and never opens.,2025-05-23,1
Capital one is a joke. Choose someone else. Gave me the run around for a month because my bank wouldn't give them personal information. They said my payment wasn't rejected and that Capital One does not need that information.,2025-05-23,1
quick silver sucks donkeys,2025-05-23,1
this app never works,2025-05-23,1
"Ok app, BUT DOES NOT GIVE AN ASCENDING TOTAL WITH EACH CHARGE.. THEREFORE, THE AMOUNT DUE EACH MONTH DOES NOT REFLECT THE ACCURATE AMOUNT ON THE CARD.. LIKE BOA'S APP DOES ........ In 2025 problem remains the same.... would use you much more except for the previously stated reason..",2025-05-23,1
I unistalled the app and re installed it.It is still slagging. Doesn't want to open. So annoying!! Please fix issue.,2025-05-23,1
"App does not load, uninstalled and reinstalled multiple times but no use. only work around is by restarting the phone everytime I want the app to start. very frustrating.",2025-05-23,1

not the best app or service to recommend,2025-05-23,1
"Do you like giving banks even more money? How about wasting your time? Not only does this app collect and sell your data, they keep adding new ads and popups while reducing the apps functionality and creating more bugs. I uninstalled bc I was so sick of it and reinstall only to deposit checks. well now that's buggy, too! Took about 20 mins and 5 attempts. Thanks for nothing capital one. I honestly don't know why I'm still with this bank. This just pushed me to look harder for a new one.",2025-05-22,1
it is not working every time I try to sign in the wheel just spins I can go online and sign in why is the app not working I'm on Android,2025-05-22,1
Stay away from this card If you pay it off within 26 days they consider that credit cycling and will cancel your credit card,2025-05-22,1
"can't open the app or navigate between screens without getting bombarded with ads. this is a banking app, not a sketchy website. do not show me ads. capital one is just the worst",2025-05-22,1
not good,2025-05-22,1
"Avoid Capital One at all cost, they have the worst policies against consumers.",2025-05-22,1
Samsung 10+ User. This app stopped working a month ago. I thought it would be fixed by now. I've uninstalled and reinstalled it to no avail.,2025-05-22,1
all of Capital one security system is a joke. all you need is a log on ID and password and you go right. there is no 2FA or any other feature that prevent accounts hacking. I cannot believe such a large bank and their security is a joke.,2025-05-22,1
capital one sucks,2025-05-22,1
I more annoyed with how the bank is growing rapidly on the backs of customers....cant wait to close my accounts,2025-05-22,1
very cumbersome at best to book things through travel portal,2025-05-22,1
Transfers to my accounts using this app take way too long. I often find myself wondering where is my money. The money at my bank might be withdrawn for 3 days and still not showing up in my capital one account. When transfering out of capital one the money is instanly no longer available but takes close to a week for a bank to actually get the funds. Transfers between my capital one savings and capital one checking take 4 days. Imagine the interest from all the customers for this time period.,2025-05-22,1

horrible to use,2025-05-22,1
I'm trying to access Zelle,2025-05-22,1
App won't go past login screen. Just sits there and spins. This needs to be fixed!,2025-05-22,1
Can take weeks to months for simple phone number verification to be registered. Even though my number is in the system and on the app I continue to get an error message stating they don't have my number. This means I have to call in and manually process items I would normally be able to do on my own with simple text verification.,2025-05-22,1
I could not get on no matter how many times I tried I could not get on seems like everything I did was wrong and it started over and over and over I have an activated this card and I don't know how I want a phone number to activate this card that's the easiest way for me I do not know computers or phones I don't like using them,2025-05-21,1
After latest update app now after logged in app I can see only Current balance in first opened window. Available credit I can see in second window. Return back when customer can see both Current balance and Available credit at the same time in first opened window after logged in app. Current balance must be changed immediately after last transaction (not after 3 days after last transaction).,2025-05-21,1
"cannot deposit checks as it keeps telling me that it can't read the check numbers. I am taking perfectly clear pictures every time and it refuses to work. I can't even get this app on my old phone to upload the check either so I guess I'm just out of luck. you are the biggest credit card company in the USA, this is unacceptable. fix your app",2025-05-21,1
App nor website gives you your statement balance. Seems like they do it on purpose so they can charge interest. And if don't pay full statement balance they punish you 3 month charging interest even if you pay statement balance on other months. This confuses customers since it mixes statement balance with current charges and make it a total balance but doesn't differ from current charges and last month balance.,2025-05-21,1
"The app is quite annoying, I have a paid charged off account that will never be removed. Usually, it wouldn't be an issue since it's paid, right? Capitol One can't remove it from their online system, on the client side, so that we can use the online services. All the things the app boasts about having and being able to use, are forever limited and unusable. Like the ""amazing"" Eno chat function to control your account.",2025-05-21,1
The app used to be fantastic but it's been a couple weeks now that it hasn't been able to log me in. Just an endless loading circle after entering my account info.,2025-05-21,1
"Travel portal is awful. The prices are, more often than not, more expensive on Cap 1. When they're not, they claim the original price was double.... then you look on hotel website and the original price is actually around 10% more and the hotel is also giving a code for the 10% off... very deceiving and untrustworthy by Capital One",2025-05-21,1
"I don't know what's going on with the app, but it basically stopped working for me today. Everything else on my phone is fine. I can't log in to my account on the app. I updated the app. Nothing. Uninstalled/reinstalled, nothing. I can log in just fine through the website, but the app isn't working. Please help.",2025-05-21,1
"Can't sign in today on android, tried all day still can't sign in. Fix this. It's just giving me the spinning loading wheel forever. Had to log in on the desktop site",2025-05-21,1

"with the switch from my Kohls account merging with capitol one it has been hidden. Thinking I didn't have any money to pay off i figured thats why the account was hidden on my capitol one. Nope, it is 3 payments passed due and diminished my credit by 200+ points, this is right before my lease expires in August. I'm basically screwed, dont get ruined by using credit.",2025-05-20,1

the day of me setting up my account didn't share any details of or about anything apparently there was suspicious activity on my account which caused my card to be restricted this tells me one of two things either there is some corruption coming from Capital One or the fraud department has a lot of bugs then trying to confirm my identity to unlock my account didn't work try to confirm it through photo of my ID it said there was a problem on their ends ridiculous,2025-05-19,1

"I hate this bank with a passion. Everything is out dated & slow. If you're dealing with a budgeted income, you will be screwed. The transfers are the slowest ever taking almost 2 weeks. They hold your checks super long. They love to put your money hostage. I sent a check for rent and they waited to take the funds but let some unauthorized merchant charge and caused my check not to be sent. The money should've been taken first. I am very close to filing a report on this bank.",2025-05-19,1

Eno is not really any help either and sometimes the app is buggy i have to reset it. Super inconvenient. It keeps telling me that i dont have any eligible numbers for 2fa for some reason and its so frustrating. I hope more effort and care is put into the app soon, as a previous Chase client its pretty dissapointing that Capital one app cant compare.",2025-05-18,1

Then last week I purchased something from Amazon accidentally using one of these closed accounts. THEY APPROVED IT. (TOS allows that..)",2025-05-10,1
out of the blue I'm a criminal as they accuse somebody of commiting fraud because an auto pay didn't go thru. how the hell is that fraud? then cancelling a long standing account on somebody that took one hell of a credit score hit on that then refusing them any right to dispute this? it's sad they have resorted to customer service being dealt with from foreign countries now. according to these foreigners they do not have a compliance dept OR A legal dept!!!!

App nor website gives you your statement balance. Seems like they do it on purpose so they can charge interest. And if don't pay full statement balance they punish you 3 month charging interest even if you pay statement balance on other months.

"The app is quite annoying, I have a paid charged off account that will never be removed. Usually, it wouldn't be an issue since it's paid, right?

"The app is functional and fine for the most part, but it is becoming more and more enundated with ads, pop ups, and offers. None of this is necessary and detracts from simply banking.

Transfers to my accounts using this app take way too long. I often find myself wondering where is my money. The money at my bank might be withdrawn for 3 days and still not showing up in my capital one account. When transfering out of capital one the money is instanly no longer available but takes close to a week for a bank to actually get the funds.

App nor website gives you your statement balance. Seems like they do it on purpose so they can charge interest. And if don't pay full statement balance they punish you 3 month charging interest even if you pay statement balance on other months.

I make small payments throughout the month till my payment is due and pay the rest and the option would show what I have left to pay. Now its gone it won't show what I have left to pay only my past balance or my full balance which includes the next month. You guys are tryn to make it harder for people to not pay interest. I will just look at my statement now and deduct the payments.,2025-05-12,4
Signing in to the app has seemed to be a problem lately.,2025-05-12,4

"Signing in has become more difficult. Even though I have authorized my device and use biometrics to log in, the app still requests a code every single time. This is new and very annoying.

"I've had what was once a good experience to a very bad one. Back in 2021 I took an online course for a total charge of $3500 to one of 5 of my credit cards.

Then last week I purchased something from Amazon accidentally using one of these closed accounts. THEY APPROVED IT. (TOS allows that..)",2025-05-10,4
out of the blue I'm a criminal as they accuse somebody of commiting fraud because an auto pay didn't go thru. how the hell is that fraud? then cancelling a long standing account on somebody that took one hell of a credit score hit on that then refusing them any right to dispute this? it's sad they have resorted to customer service being dealt with from foreign countries now. according to these foreigners they do not have a compliance dept OR A legal dept!!!!

I have had trouble with this app. they have my balance incorrect and there credit rating system put my credit score down a point even though my balance was zero and I pay off my card every month.,2025-04-26,4

would like ab option to pay bill anytime not just when due.,2025-04-26,4

"There was an update made that took away my ability to see the ""remaining statement balance"" when making my cc payment. Now it just shows ""last statement balance"" without the recalculated balance after payments have been made. It seems a little predatory. It seems like they think more mistakes will be made by the customer in hopes of being able to charge interest. I understand you don't HAVE to provide that feature and we can do simple maths but it seems shady.",2025-04-22,4

nice app... would be even more functional with a widget access for Android,2025-04-22,4
the opt out of minimum payment each month needs to be more user friendly when you are paying in full. It seems ridiculous to pay a small amount and a large amount each month especially with business because you have to separate expenses into categories for tax purposes.,2025-04-22,4

Used to see the remaining statement balance but that option is gone now. Hopefully just an error and gets fixed otherwise seems like a way to confuse people to pay more early or to earn interest from people not knowing remaining balance.,2025-04-17,4
