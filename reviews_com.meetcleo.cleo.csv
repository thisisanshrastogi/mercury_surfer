"got first advance paid back,24hrs later can't advance me goodbye Cleo your a piece of 💩 app",2025-06-12,1
Took 14.99 from me. they won't let me use all the money on my card through a transaction nor through ATM withdrawal,2025-06-12,1
horrible experience,2025-06-12,1
you know you guys are scam you are for a cash advance but only if I subscribe to some plan to give you guys money to pay for that plan but why would I need a cash advance if I had money to pay for a plan the plan costs more than what an advanced you would give me would be,2025-06-12,1
they take out unexplained fees over and over and claim it's partial repayment even though they take it way before due date and they never deduct what they take from the balance and there's no way to contact them other than the useless AI chat bot that doesn't understand anything and answers no questions and keeps telling you to contact customer support when the bot is the only customer support they have,2025-06-12,1
it's broke and won't work what's wrong with it,2025-06-11,1
not worth it. too many problems,2025-06-11,1
The app makes you sign up for a monthly service and charges you before you find out if you are eligible for a cash advance...only to deny the request for money.,2025-06-11,1
you might as well not get this app. I've been trying for like 30 mins now to figure out why I owe a statement balance when all I've been doing is using the cash advance portion and paying it off and now its saying I owe over 200 dollars and there's nothing I can find that says why like if the card i was using was actually a credit card me thinking oh its just a card for the account like the digital card to get the advance. I closed my account.,2025-06-11,1
"App had a nasty way of communicating. I did a lot of work to get passive aggressive douche bags out of my life so when an app does it, hell no. These people are the worst.",2025-06-11,1
Says I'm eligible for an advance but an error message constantly pops up. Complete waste of 25 mins signing up.,2025-06-11,1
just try and get customer support.... you won't,2025-06-11,1
I proceeded to sign up and go to get a $40 cash advance. but it says I couldn't do it at this time after it said I could get it a few times. but when I finally went to confirm it it said something went wrong and I couldn't get it at this time. when I go to delete my account it says I have to make repayments. so at this time I can't unsubscribe or delete my account and I haven't even taken anything from Cleo!,2025-06-11,1

"I requested an advance, never received it, and the chat is dumb and doesn't understand when I ask where my advance is. worst app ever! plus, it's impossible to get a customer on the phone.",2025-06-10,1
"This recent revamping of the Cleo app is awful. I loved Cleo up until this point. I now have two main issues with this app since this revamping. The first issue is admittedly insignificant--i hate how the fun, purple theme was changed to an ugly and depressing brown. My other issue is a lot more concerning--I can't cancel my subscription to Plus! Cleo acts dumb when I tell her I want to cancel, and I keep getting a 'there was a problem' message when I try to cancel manually. This is awful.",2025-06-10,1
you have to pay monthly subscription. and if you want to cancel the app doesn't let you and its extremely difficult to get in touch with real customer service and the app is very bugged and glitchy,2025-06-10,1

"BE AWARE!! It has saved me plenty of times, since the new update its a SCAM!!! (06/2025) They tell you that you qualify as a builder get an extra $80 and you have to pay. But you have to transfer your own money to qualify. Then after you cancel they reset your time to get money, by the way they never mention that anywhere!!! I canceled this service.",2025-06-10,1
The app tracks your spending unwarranted. Sends you too many messages that aren't funny or ok. There was an option to stop the tracking that has now mysteriously disappeared. The help options are few.,2025-06-09,1
The worst app ever is not guaranteed but just want to take your membership payment and find excuses.,2025-06-09,1

so far this is one of the most dumb of all dumb apps I want my money back,2025-06-09,1
"I used to have zero problems with Cleo, I used it regularly and had good experiences with them. Now, after 1 simple mistake on my part with a repayment on an advance, and attempting to fix said mistake, their customer service has declined significantly. Trying to get a hold of a live person is impossible, every time I attempt to message anyone or get help, I'm ignored. On top of that, even with my balance at zero now, the app STILL claims I owe them money. I will never recommend them again.",2025-06-09,1

"Everything positive I said about Cleo is now out the windows. They NOW divide your cash advance, letting you only take out half of the full amount at a time. This practice in itself is scummy and unethical. Because instead of charging $7.99 for express once, NOW they charge express twice, getting an extra $8 out of you. Avoid at all costs. deleting my account after payday.",2025-06-09,1

hidden fees read the fine print,2025-06-08,1
you want to charge me a fee to help save me money. you want me to pay you to save me money. that just doesn't make sense. why would I pay you? scam. there is no concern from me I just know your a scam app. try again with your nonsense reply,2025-06-08,1
I couldn't get into the app I downloaded Cleo and I got a blank screen when I push the open,2025-06-08,1
NOT INTERESTED!,2025-06-08,1
"tried setting up a credit builder account but every time I try to pay with my debit card it says there is an issue. Called my bank and there were no problems with my card or my wife's card and neither would go through, tried multiple times. Also, the app typically crashes 2-3 times every time I try to use it.",2025-06-08,1
I never got my builder's card so I have 40 Dollard floating around somewhere I never spent but paid back can't get another advance and you just took 599 from my checking and won't refund it even though I just canceled my subscription,2025-06-08,1
"Been a member for a few years and somehow they are STILL terrible at getting the next paycheck date right. Sometimes they get it right, other times they come up with a random date then base your repayment date off that so then they want you to repay before your next paycheck even came in and you now have to clean up the mess they created, wasting your time with the useless chat bot that traps you with its useless answers rather than forwarding you to a person. Extending doesn't help me either.",2025-06-08,1

I just built a account with them assuming I could get a cash advance to help with gas till pay day. now I can't access the cash advance then they charge me for subscription an put me in negative adding on a overdraft fee of 32 dollars. now for me to cancel account I have to pay the 30 dollar towards the cash advance I can't access yet an I will not be refunded on the subscription fee after just canceling it after I subscribed. smh this apps just put you in a bind then help you.,2025-06-08,1

"paid for subscription,now cant cancel because I never received a cash advance,and they are trying to take money off my card but tells me to link my bank , and cant talk to anyone about cancelling this",2025-06-07,1
when I try to get the advance it asked to verify card number which is same card for my main direct deposit keeps saying error but the same card worked for them to take the membership fee!! but won't let me get the advance 😕 so I basically paid for a membership that I can't use!!! Then they say check your bank it's there fault well it's not bc it worked just fine for another advance app! and it worked just fine for them to take the membership fee 😡,2025-06-07,1
"This Cleo app is a JOKE! I submitted my personal Account info but when I clicked ""Request"" to get a Cash Advance it just kept going back to the column to pay the Cleo Plus or Cleo Advance monthly fee. I am already subscribed to Cleo Plus. Do not apply in this app! It will get all your Personal & Banking Info then the app does not respond after you click ""Request"". This App is definitely a SCAM!! BEWARE!!!",2025-06-07,1

This app sucks. If you like being abused via text from a machine that constantly tries you to get into debt via cash advance then this is your app. If you have a clue and don't think getting into deeper debt is the way to manage your finances then avoid this silly app. I am not fond of the name Cleo either. One star is the lowest rating. Because zero stars doesn't register on anything.,2025-06-07,1
worst app ever,2025-06-07,1
Your graphics were better before! not a fan of this new beige and bland cleo..,2025-06-07,1
"Cash advances are too small like you can only get a piece of the total borrowing power they offer, the 24hr hold before getting another cash advance is super inconvenient, the instant cash transfer options are too expensive for the measly amounts you're able to advance and the idea of paying more on a subscription for a higher advance when it should be based off income is just too ridiculous to consider. I'm sure there are better options out there.",2025-06-07,1
app never works,2025-06-07,1
its a scam.,2025-06-07,1
subscription service... bs app,2025-06-07,1
Dont download this app. Took my subscription fee $5.99 but never gave me the cash advance. Try dave or earning. Cleo sucks.,2025-06-07,1
your app wont let me extend my repayment date because it says i already did which i did not!!!!! your chat box is ridiculous!!!! i need the date changed!!!,2025-06-06,1
I got an advance for $120 and they took $679 out of my account. now I cant pay rent and I'm going to get kicked out of my house,2025-06-06,1
not the greatest,2025-06-06,1
When I started getting advances they were large amounts. I pay on time or early in full. They give you less each time as a penalty and no reward for being a good customer. very disappointing. filed with better business Bureau. NOTHING HAS CHANGED. PAID 580 GOT 460 NEXT TIME 280 PAID EARLY GOT 210. SCAMMERS THEY DO NOT UPDATE THE BANK ACCOUNT ON A TIMELY MANNER AND USE WRONG FINANCIAL INFORMATION. MY MISTAKE TO PAY MY 280 THE SAME DAY AND THEN GIVEN 210. SORRY WE NEED TO LIVE ON THIS MONEY.,2025-06-06,1
soo far this is the worst app I've seen in the year you need a monthly subscription and an extra fee 5$ in the first time let you take 30$ but the charge you 20$ before that does make any sense,2025-06-06,1
I borrowed and they only give 40 dollars thats a joke and they want you to upgrade and pay more,2025-06-06,1
having to pay for a subscription to borrow money is not ideal probably for most people who are in need of a loan.,2025-06-06,1
"when I first started using cleo the app would actually help me. I was able to make some commitments to save money. The cash advances sure came in handy. I could see my own progress with becoming more financially responsible. cleo has become an app that is taking all sorts of fees from me and provides me with no service. though I've continued to receive all the same d.deposits and have all my accts connected. I've paid back my advances on time even early, but cleo has decided no more $advances.",2025-06-05,1
im unable to get a refund of my $5.99 that I paid the same time I requested a cash advance because the card connected to my bank account is a prepaid card and they won't do an advance to a prepaid card. I just want my $5.99 back because I cancelled my subscription.,2025-06-05,1
Amount of advance changes drastically even when you pay back on time every time.,2025-06-05,1
Absolutely NO Help when You don't have a Physical Brick and Mortar Bank. Saying can't Verify my Income and Finances but yet Had No problem linking my Venmo Account which I Receive my Direct Deposits on and it shows ALL PREVIOUS TRANSACTIONS.,2025-06-05,1
Too low..60 bucks..high fees. Not optimal,2025-06-05,1
"cannot reach an actual agent, was not happy with offers.",2025-06-05,1
"every time I try to do an advance it says something went wrong, please try again later. but nothing goes wrong with them collecting the subscription fees. Just paying for nothing!",2025-06-05,1
"The app is toying with me. I repaid my loan of $40 sooner because I didn't need the loan just for it to be $30 afterwards. I don't have the patience to pay for the subscription to figure if I can get up to $250. I did accidentally hit request eligible for new amount right after I paid. It was a reflex. I borrow and pay back what I want to pay. I don't have credit cards. I feel left out because of the $10 decrease. I'll only need it when I have it, I guess. *deleted acct* wit the quickness.",2025-06-05,1
app doesn't work,2025-06-04,1
"in the beginning Cleo was great, but now by the time you pay you subscription fee, all you are doing is paying the interest on the $30 or $40 advance your getting and you get charged a fee to send the money to your account as well. now add all that together, and Cleo is making a killing off of us. never made it past $50 what happened to the other $200 Cleo is a joke, and then talked bad about Moneylion now that the app that helps you you should try it. it's awesome 😎",2025-06-04,1
"They took $5.99 from me and now every month but they are telling me I don't qualify for a loan because I received a bonus on top of my regular paycheck which apparently confuses ""Cleo"" and places me into an income change that affects my ability to borrow. I can't get anyone to help me. I either deal with an AI bot for assistance or someone who types out generic responses when I explain my situation. I really needed to borrow money for moving expenses! Beware of this app! Not recommending!",2025-06-04,1
"I have never had a bad experience with this app before. I have used it quite often. But it seems after the newest app up date, things got messed up. My advance repayment went through, and I canceled my subscription, The next page said your subscription has been canceled successfully, and you will no longer be charged for your subscription. I was still charged, and no confirming cancelation email was sent to me. Now I can't get my refund because I can't prove that it said it was canceled.",2025-06-04,1

TRASH....pure trash and a waste of time. They expect you to pay a monthly subscription just to even start the services. I don't see how that's helping.,2025-06-03,1

"the app will have no issue taking your subscription fees, but if you have any issues due to their app they will basically shrug their shoulders and claim there is nothing they can do, absolutely horrible support team, I recommend you stay far away from this app, check out empower, moneylion or Earnin instead.",2025-06-03,1

"Wants you to subscribe and pay $6 immediately before you can even start to use it or see what amount you can borrow. from what I see you then pay at least $9 to get whatever small amount they offer you if anything, which is already more than my overdraft fee, so I didn't go through with it.

They lie just to get your info and then they don't help you I paid my advance back and have the receipt Cleo sent me showing I paided it but they all they want is to connect to my bank and they will see if I paid..but they won't take there own receipt that they sent me ..what's the use of the receipt if y'all ain't gonna honor it...fake people and I am reporting this app...,2025-05-28,1
poor customer service. nobody helps or answers questions. I will not recommend Cleo to anyone,2025-05-28,1
that sucks that you have to pick one star when they should get zero 40 days it's saying something's wrong but when I did ask Cleo they said just to wait a while I waited a whole day and it still saying it it's fraudulent because they took the 599 out of my account to pay for their stupid membership but they won't give the cash advance and they are playing games they just changed my Advance amount 2:30 instead of 40 and it's still not giving it to me saying something is wrong,2025-05-28,1
Cleo took multiple payments within a week they took 16898 on the 23rd of May and they took 16898 on the 27th of May and they took $38 for my subscription so there's a 168 98 payment too much but they took and now I have to live in my car and I can't seem to get a hold of anybody to get my money returned,2025-05-27,1
got be careful with this app it will randomly steal money from you.,2025-05-27,1
they do not respond to you they have a robot The robot is very disrespectful The robot will not answer your questions only what they feel like they will answer only what they feel they can handle Cleo doesn't have a direct contact so when you do put your money in be prepared to only be able to withdraw through the ATM you cannot put it on any other platform to transfer money that is what they're not going to tell you when you go in to the Western Union it doesn't accept it's a lot of places this,2025-05-27,1
It caused me money I tried to borrow and it took my money from my account and also the 30 they gave me so it left me stuck short of cash and I still dont have my refund its been three days my next step is to contact bbb and report the company no way it should take this long to refund my money back to my card my money for my gas back and forth to work I had to borrow money from family because of this its frustrating cant talk to no one only a computer this is bad business no understanding,2025-05-27,1
"Theyre constantly changing the amount you can borrow even though nothing on my side changes, whether it's my spending or my income. I even finished one of their ""challenges"" this week to improve my eligibility for cash advance... and it was literally cut in half AFTER I manually paid it back on time.

Also, physical card never showed; it also states in the app that it was never delivered.",2025-05-25,1
"screwed up my bank account so bad, that I can't pay bills no nothing. this started after they deemed my debit card fraud because they were trying to pull funds about 8 days before anything was due. had a long talk with my bank about this and sent screen shots to my bank as well",2025-05-25,1

"One Star – Misleading and Frustrating! Cleo promised me an advance and got me to provide my credit card information as part of the process.

I have been trying to close my account and get the money that was left in both the checking and the savings accounts for over 2.5 months now. Customer Service sucks. I've been trying for over 2 months to get a hold of ANYONE. MY MONEY HAS NOT BEEN GIVEN BACK TO ME. And I can't take out my savings which I put in to begin with. I thought this app was going to help me instead it just stole from me.,2025-05-23,1

"went through 15mins or so of signing up. it sat there and said my base for borrowing was $200. then when I hit borrow it only allowed 100. then the same card they charged me on for the subscription which is capital one they wouldn't allow for borrowing. so they basically charged me their $6 for nothing. then if you cancel, they remove access right away even though you paid for a month. what SDE made this terrible design?",2025-05-23,1

hate it can't talk to a live person,2025-05-22,1
"This is a SCAM. I borrowed 150 and paid it back early. When I paid went to request another advance I was now only approved for 60 unless I upgrade the subscription to some sort of builder. Absolutely a scam. They charge 8.99 EXTRA for an express fee if u want to get the advance deposited instantly. This is on top of already having a subscription. By the time you are done paying all the fees, you have racked up a ridiculous amount of additional costs. Other advance apps DO NOT DO THIS.",2025-05-21,1

There are better options out there. I can't even speak to someone at customer service. It's probably because everyone wants a refund. Get Dave Or Earn In. Told me if I subscribe I would get a higher advance amount. The additional service was the same as the amount of my advance. What a rip off. UPDATE- Got charged another 34.00 and I finally got it cancelled problem is now I want to borrow 50 bucks and That is not an option anymore. so basically you need to pay to borrow and also still pay fees.,2025-05-13,1

Now since Cleo changed their method and split the advance into 2, you have to pay back double the express fee! Shady!!!!!",2025-05-10,1

when I try to get the advance it asked to verify card number which is same card for my main direct deposit keeps saying error but the same card worked for them to take the membership fee!! but won't let me get the advance 😕 so I basically paid for a membership that I can't use!!!

This app sucks. If you like being abused via text from a machine that constantly tries you to get into debt via cash advance then this is your app. If you have a clue and don't think getting into deeper debt is the way to manage your finances then avoid this silly app. I am not fond of the name Cleo either. One star is the lowest rating. Because zero stars doesn't register on anything.,2025-06-07,2

"Cash advances are too small like you can only get a piece of the total borrowing power they offer, the 24hr hold before getting another cash advance is super inconvenient, the instant cash transfer options are too expensive for the measly amounts you're able to advance and the idea of paying more on a subscription for a higher advance when it should be based off income is just too ridiculous to consider.

They give you less each time as a penalty and no reward for being a good customer. very disappointing. filed with better business Bureau. NOTHING HAS CHANGED. PAID 580 GOT 460 NEXT TIME 280 PAID EARLY GOT 210. SCAMMERS THEY DO NOT UPDATE THE BANK ACCOUNT ON A TIMELY MANNER AND USE WRONG FINANCIAL INFORMATION. MY MISTAKE TO PAY MY 280 THE SAME DAY AND THEN GIVEN 210. SORRY WE NEED TO LIVE ON THIS MONEY.,2025-06-06,2
soo far this is the worst app I've seen in the year you need a monthly subscription and an extra fee 5$ in the first time let you take 30$ but the charge you 20$ before that does make any sense,2025-06-06,2
I borrowed and they only give 40 dollars thats a joke and they want you to upgrade and pay more,2025-06-06,2

that sucks that you have to pick one star when they should get zero 40 days it's saying something's wrong but when I did ask Cleo they said just to wait a while I waited a whole day and it still saying it it's fraudulent because they took the 599 out of my account to pay for their stupid membership but they won't give the cash advance and they are playing games they just changed my Advance amount 2:30 instead of 40 and it's still not giving it to me saying something is wrong,2025-05-28,2
Cleo took multiple payments within a week they took 16898 on the 23rd of May and they took 16898 on the 27th of May and they took $38 for my subscription so there's a 168 98 payment too much but they took and now I have to live in my car and I can't seem to get a hold of anybody to get my money returned,2025-05-27,2
got be careful with this app it will randomly steal money from you.,2025-05-27,2
they do not respond to you they have a robot The robot is very disrespectful The robot will not answer your questions only what they feel like they will answer only what they feel they can handle Cleo doesn't have a direct contact so when you do put your money in be prepared to only be able to withdraw through the ATM you cannot put it on any other platform to transfer money that is what they're not going to tell you when you go in to the Western Union it doesn't accept it's a lot of places this,2025-05-27,2

"screwed up my bank account so bad, that I can't pay bills no nothing. this started after they deemed my debit card fraud because they were trying to pull funds about 8 days before anything was due. had a long talk with my bank about this and sent screen shots to my bank as well",2025-05-25,2

"One Star – Misleading and Frustrating! Cleo promised me an advance and got me to provide my credit card information as part of the process.

I have been trying to close my account and get the money that was left in both the checking and the savings accounts for over 2.5 months now. Customer Service sucks. I've been trying for over 2 months to get a hold of ANYONE. MY MONEY HAS NOT BEEN GIVEN BACK TO ME. And I can't take out my savings which I put in to begin with. I thought this app was going to help me instead it just stole from me.,2025-05-23,2
I wanted to borrow to my card not yours and I unsubscribed your card. so I can't borrow no more unless I used your card. so I'm deleting cleo,2025-05-23,2
"went through 15mins or so of signing up. it sat there and said my base for borrowing was $200. then when I hit borrow it only allowed 100. then the same card they charged me on for the subscription which is capital one they wouldn't allow for borrowing. so they basically charged me their $6 for nothing. then if you cancel, they remove access right away even though you paid for a month. what SDE made this terrible design?",2025-05-23,2

hate it can't talk to a live person,2025-05-22,2
"This is a SCAM. I borrowed 150 and paid it back early. When I paid went to request another advance I was now only approved for 60 unless I upgrade the subscription to some sort of builder. Absolutely a scam. They charge 8.99 EXTRA for an express fee if u want to get the advance deposited instantly. This is on top of already having a subscription. By the time you are done paying all the fees, you have racked up a ridiculous amount of additional costs. Other advance apps DO NOT DO THIS.",2025-05-21,2

I thought the update would be cool, I completed my boosts and it offered me $50 advance but now it is not available again.

"cash advance is extremely inconsistent. You can go from 150, paid on time to 40.",2025-05-17,2
I've had a horrible experience with the Chloe app. I have paid my advances back on time. And they have not given me advances even though I have a direct deposit.

There are better options out there. I can't even speak to someone at customer service. It's probably because everyone wants a refund. Get Dave Or Earn In. Told me if I subscribe I would get a higher advance amount. The additional service was the same as the amount of my advance. What a rip off. UPDATE- Got charged another 34.00 and I finally got it cancelled problem is now I want to borrow 50 bucks and That is not an option anymore. so basically you need to pay to borrow and also still pay fees.,2025-05-13,2

sorry,2025-05-10,2
"App is ok if you need a small advance. The only thing that I have a major problem with right now, is Cleo changing their advance terms and conditions by splitting up the advance into 2 loans, then charging for the extra express fee per advance. Before this, customers used to be able to get their total advance at once, and pay one express fee. Now since Cleo changed their method and split the advance into 2, you have to pay back double the express fee! Shady!!!!!",2025-05-10,2

Plus, the app has gotten so difficult to load lately. I haven't even been able to check anything on it at all today, I keep being told ""there's been a problem"".

Every time I use this app it keeps crashing. A box with a message pops up saying close the app or wait. it's getting pretty annoying.,2025-05-06,2
"HOW DO YOU DAY RIP OFF!!!! 🤔The app seems to offer some helpful tools for credit building, saving money and spending but at the cost of what the app is charging for it's services is not worth it being as how you have other apps that exist to offer the same tools for less or at no cost at all like ""CHIME"", ""EMPOWER"" and ""DAVE"". ""CLEO"" charging you $5.99 monthly for the app might not be a lot to some but then your offering you to borrow money at $5.99 PER ADVANCE. NOT WORTH IT! 🤔🧐",2025-05-02,2
I have asked 3 times to cancel my subscription you keep saying May24 I would like it cancelled now. I will not be responsible for any charged after today May 1st,2025-05-02,2
"the app is inconsistent with the amount you can borrow. due to the amount not staying the same each time, it can out you in terrible debt and do more harm then help. cleo how are you going to let me borrow 300, and then cut it back to 150? rude and inconvenient.",2025-05-01,2
And you guys keep asking me to verify my identity for the last 3 days.I've been trying to upload a photo and not one.It makes no easy to find out.How to do that now?I have Uploaded my photo and you still haven't verified my identity.What do I need to do to it?Can somebody give me a human response,2025-05-01,2
app needs immediate addressing.. i cannot login because when i try to type the code sent to my email the app is not allowing me to even get to my keyboard. and I've always payed my advances on time so this is pretty annoying. So hopefully you address that issue cause how am i supposed to pay when i cannot even get in.,2025-04-28,2
very misleading. For instance they say if you refer some one you was get x amount of dollars well no they just raise a borrowing limit temporarily and you pay it back. also they say you can borrow 80 huck. well you can only borrow 40 upfront then you have to wait 24hrs also you ha e very limited payback time,2025-04-27,2
"Don't apply for builder and then change your mind, my borrow amount was cut in half and hasn't changed back. Not worth having the app anymore",2025-04-27,2
"Huge warning: Only two weeks into the current month's paid subscription, they already charged me for an additional month that I would not need. AI chatbot will not refund you for the extra month you're not even in because you're still in the month you got a cash withdrawal. All that is paid back and done, I do not need another month of Cleo Plus. It took about 15 minutes to get to real customer service agent and get them to refund me. You pay Plus subscription + big withdrawal fees for advances.",2025-04-26,2
I was charged twice this month for the subscription fee 04/12 and 04/24 when I should be charge once a month. I will be calling my bank for my money back and cancel my subscription.,2025-04-25,2
hard with cash adbance,2025-04-25,2
"it was great, but last few days it freezes on verifying email and won't open , tried reinstall and checked for updates, nada. I've communicated it to them and have gotten no response as of yet....it is what it is, they are the ones losing money.",2025-04-24,2
App has nothing but issues. Advances were nice. was unable to access virtual card info as the info screen constantly froze the app. got the card after about 10 days but cannot even activate due to the app freezing.. will update if I get help.,2025-04-24,2
"I was told I have to wait a few hours before the customer service team will respond. okay that's fine, but I don't know how they are going to contact me? text, email? nothing! I'm getting more and more pissed off.",2025-04-22,2
takes forever and accomplish nothing,2025-04-21,2
"Making you take an $80 advance out as $40 and $40 so you get hit with a $7 fee BOTH times for 1 advance? So $14 for your whole advance, plus $15 a month? That is why I use Cleo the least, only if I've already used Dave, Empower, and Brigit, usually 1 or 2 of the reasonable apps is good enough.",2025-04-18,2
it keeps saying my payment for cleo plus failed. it did not and it came out of my account. it keeps trying to make me pay the 5.99 again but it keeps failing even though I have money in my checking account. it won't let me re borrow because it keeps saying I'm not subscribed to cleo plus. please fix this. also the AI tool is absolutely useless!,2025-04-16,2
I deleted because it said l owed n l payed it back way before the due date got it on my bank statement to prove it. l will try again maybe they fixed the problem. well now another problem l can't login in trying to connect bank info n it's frozen still frozen uninstall n reinstall no better! clean gets no stars in my experience,2025-04-16,2
what do you connect to? my bank kept saying your credentials wrong and I changed my password two times and it still didn't work,2025-04-15,2
Misleading,2025-04-14,2
Cleo is off the free money Friday sweepstakes ends on may30th and she said we will be notified on March 14th which is a month ago and them she said I was right it's may 7th that's 2 weeks before it ends. If she can't get a simple date correct how are we supposed to trust anything within the cleo app? This is our money not just some game or something it's our MONEY...what else has she been wrong on or with this is scary especially dealing with out lively hood! Something is definitely not right!,2025-04-11,2
ok,2025-04-11,2
keep asking for my card that never arrived and you bot system sucks,2025-04-11,2
I was renewing my membership after my advance was paid back now it's saying my card don't work? Which I have money on both accounts? It was working fine. I like the app but if going do this type of stuff I'm not going use it.,2025-04-10,2
hasn't cleared what I owe when it been paid for,2025-04-10,2
"Eligibility is very inconsistent. AI chat bot, although intuitive and somewhat impressive is unable to provide what I would consider to be acceptable reasons for changes in cash advance eligibility. If you're desperate and need funds immediately, this app is better than some of the others out there but be careful. This could become a financial crutch you're unable to get rid of. I decided to quit while I'm ahead, cancel and uninstall.",2025-04-10,2
This app got off to a great Start. What turned me off was how the app AI became annoying by snooping through my accounts and making little Sarcastic remarks about my spending habits.,2025-04-08,2

$6 monthly fee to get a cash advance.,2025-03-29,2
the point of a cash advance is cause im broke till payday not cause I have all bit of money and need more,2025-03-29,2
It won't take my subscription payment so I can get a advance,2025-03-27,2
This app is good but they RECHARGE you 3 times..! I had a friend tell me bout this app I used it in Feb I borrowed $50 for a bill but ATM I was unemployed so I had too keep changing my repay dates so fast forward too March 25th they took out $20 then notice they took out additional $26.99 THEN additional $5.99 .. I don't know where the $26.99 came from I asked the company about they said that was they express fee price so then I notice my receipt the express fee was $6. TODAY THEY DID IT AGAIN!,2025-03-26,2
"if I need a cash advance, then I prbly don't have extra $$ sitting there for a monthly subscription I just put my last $7 in the tank, now you want $5.99 why don't you set up that first payment to come out of the cash advance??",2025-03-26,2
Used to work generally well but the most recent update broke the app with constant pop-ups about in app tasks that come up random as you're trying to do something. App still functions but very close to being unusable and has become an atrocious user experience.,2025-03-21,2
Lousy customer support. Chat bots are limited. Repayment date is 2 weeks,2025-03-17,2
I changed my review because it will not let me link my bank card to get an advance but it let me put it for a subscription which makes no sense,2025-03-15,2
Add cash function stopped working. Almost impossible to get customer support.,2025-03-12,2
"Cute app and idea but it is way to random with advance eligibility. Example It let me advance $65 out of $130 saying that was the daily limit, I took out the $65 then now the other half disappeared and can't take anything out until its paid. Another time it let me take out $120 one paycheck and when I paid it back on time with the same direct deposit amount it only let me take out $40 for next pay period. Customer service said they had no idea why",2025-03-11,2
Not good . Cleo gave me advance for 7 months and I changed banks and they stopped giving them to me ( and I was paying the highest subscription) and I still can't get one. I also referred kelley McClain and never even got 5.00 for referring a friend,2025-03-10,2
Was great at first then after they took the second payment now the app doesn't work,2025-03-10,2
I'm hoping for good luck let's see how it goes,2025-03-06,2
Has features but even with my 700+ credit score and paying they're $40 bundle only allotted $30 to borrow.,2025-03-02,2
They play games with your advanced. U can't talk to a human. Cleo will make changes to your account without notice. Then I won't get another advance but they will take your money for a subscription u can't use. Only to make u upgrade and pay more. Bad all around.,2025-03-01,2
They are a joke !,2025-03-01,2
Better than Brigit but still not great.,2025-02-25,2

What happened to the app? It's giving me problems now. For the past 3 days I have been getting charged $5.00 &$5.89 twice a day and when I tried to talk to your chat it didn't understand me and now today I can't get into my account it's like I started all over again. It's telling me to update the app but there's no update to do.

"The Cleo AI itself is peak NPC brain behavior. No critical thinking, no adapting to the conversation, just a scripted loop of corporate-friendly responses that make it even more unbearable.

For once in my life they need to fix an app where when they ask you about what your issue is that you can give your actual issue to them yourself instead of having a multiple choice about what you're wanting to say cuz that's not helping the matters none at all anyways hopefully this review reaches someone that can reach out to me because I'm having issues contacting them I'm having issues with the documents because my bank account is paperless I cannot do a screenshot on a paperless account,2025-02-11,2
It does not let me choose a next month day for pay back I get paid once a month on the third and it would not let me select a next month date and it showed no half slash on the date and month I was trying to choose,2025-02-10,2
Hard to remove from your phone. Double check to make sure they are double and triple charging you for small loans.,2025-02-08,2

The app has suddenly stopped working. It's stuck on one thing and won't let me exit out to access the rest of the app.,2025-02-03,2
"Well, first, you have to subscribe, and that costs $5.99, so if your flat-out broke, this app won't help you. Second, they charge you fees on top of the subscriptions to get the money instantly. This is why anyone using this app is here, right? So, all in all, use it for your month, unsubscribe (so they don't get you because they will), and delete. However, the app worked, and the money was in my account quickly.",2025-01-27,2
I need a payday advance,2025-01-19,2
I like this app however it sucks that almost every time your in the middle of doing something it will freeze and lock up forcing you to close and open the app never being able to get something done. If that would be fixed my rating would be much higher,2025-01-19,2
I like that it allows me to borrow money until I get paid but I'm having a issue with the credit builder card it says it's delivered but I have not received it an this was 2 months ago,2025-01-16,2

The loans are reasonable but after you've been using it for a while it starts acting funny like won't let pay my subscription which is 14.99 a month but it allowed me to repay my loan but can't get anything else payments have been made on time and this happens,2025-01-03,2
This app is not what they say for while it was cool then I payed attention to thy where making double pay my subscription then not allowing me to get my other have my advance til the first advance was paid or you pay your subscription and still nothing now I'm canceling my whole subscription because they're say I didn't pay it even when I'm showing.

So the app was great and it truly helped me out when I was in a jam but I just want people to know I subscribed to a 3 month agreement and they gave me a 30$ bost for any future advances but they also told me to apply for their card and I did and when I was going through the steps they offered a promotion which I needed to complete some task in 30days and I would get even more advances in the future. The app logged me out and it doesn't exist. Customer service basically said nothing we can do.,2025-01-01,2

I just hate when apps lie to the people to make money like they say theyll give you a advance but soon as you try to get one you end up paying money to them lol like im looking for money not looking to pay you money its obvious im ouy of a job like what makes you think ill need it when i get a job i dont understand these apps.,2024-12-28,2
"The app promises you can get an advance up to $500, but you have to pay up front for the subscription and that is the only way to get an advance. If one reads the fine print, the advance promised can range from $2- $250, so long as you dont have any outstanding advanced. That is why you have to pay up front for the dubscription, because after you pay the $14.99 your advance may only be $5, so youd actually lose $10 first month and be stuck owing every month after.

Tried to get help and was told it was escalated to a team to get this fixed and refunded and would have a response within 1-3 business days. Great! Over a week later and still haven't heard anything.

Your advertisement online seems deceptive. The black guy says you can borrow 80 and that's all you pay back and we all know that's not true nothing's for free. You also say that you get the advance immediately and that's not the case I had to wait a day for it if I'm taking out an advantage it's because I need it right there and then so that was disappointing.,2024-12-03,2

I cannot find where to login on at anywhere.,2024-11-27,2
I make 1600 a week and it gave me 50 dollars to start which is nothing actually technically it was 7 dollar charge so not even 50. Which again 50 dollars when you have to a premium membership fee plus The fee they charge for not waiting 3 to 4 business days it's actually a rip off.,2024-11-23,2
"It was great until today. The money for my payment was removed from my checking account, however Cleo is saying that I am overdue and it wasn't paid.

Then it leaves you with that gap between payperiods that she used to help out with. Dont bother with customer service, its nonexistent. If u do by chance get a human, they claim to not be in control of Cleo, that she cannot be fixed on their end. Not cool, Cleo.",2024-11-16,2
"This app sucks sometimes. They don't let the other amount come to your bank account. It say's processing or something like that untill you have to pay it back. You only get one advance, I should say. It works when it wants, I should say that also.",2024-11-15,2
Still sucks,2024-11-15,2
I love Cleo she gives high advances I just don't like the fact that I missed one subscription payment and now it's been over a month and a half and she still won't let me barrow so for that your getting two stars,2024-11-14,2

Not really helpful. They decide how little you can borrow for 15 days..,2024-11-02,2
In my experience this app hasn't been helpful. I opened it awhile ago then closed it and reopened some time later using a different account. The advances (40$ btw) keep going to the old account I disconnected! Now payment is due when I never actually received the advance. Theirs no way to get actual assistance on this app from a human not a bot!,2024-10-31,2

I'm having the worst time ever with my advance been doing this since yesterday and chatting with a bot who is not helping me. I'm so sad and frustrated. I paid for plus got advance to borrow. I believe 35 dollars. my bank accounts are connected to cleo... then when it gets to step 3 it just sits there and does nothing.

"It's ok. Although, it doesnt charge anything other than what you borrow...which is nice! It also doesnt offer much TO borrow either.",2024-10-18,2
The app is like a loop and takes you on a desperate ride to looking for answers which are not at all forthcoming in the chat option. I'm mad beyond description as my credit builder card hasn't arrived in the mail for almost a month now and I can't seem to talk to customer care which made my experience even worse. They really need to work on this.,2024-10-17,2
I haven't been able to borrow anything even though it says that I am eligible. Says that I can get my credit score for no charge. I have tried to get my credit score twice and both times I have been unable to get it. The app just wants me to. Upgrade to the paid version. 2 stars was probably 2 stars too many,2024-10-16,2
The app is very easy to access. But you can get a loan pay it back early or put back on time and you're still going to get the same amount as last time or maybe even lower. And on top of that it only uses one of my accounts when I can't understand why they don't use Cashspps account because that's where a lot of my money comes from so they got stuff a little backwards,2024-10-12,2

To be honest it's OK for a quick few bucks in a hurry but the amounts you can borrow always change and they never go up they always go down they want you to subscribe to get more or invite friends but they charge a fee for borrowing anyways so why have a different subscription when you already pay for one the highest I was able to borrow was 90 now it's down to 75 even though I pay it back on time most times even early makes no sense,2024-10-10,2
Have to pay fee before you can see the advance amount. And the fee to advance ratio is nearly twice as much as other options. Waste of 5.99,2024-10-10,2

"I have had Cleo several months. I have taken out a small amt on payday and repaid it and have never missed or been late. Two weeks ago, after repaying, it told me I was ineligible for a new one. A few days later it finally approved me but at a lower amount. Now here we are again, payday comes and I repay my loan and I cannot take another one out. My payday and salary haven't changed, my spending habits haven't changed yet I can't take money out and no one can tell me why!!",2024-09-30,2

Well started out great then convinced me to do the card thing still haven't received the card but money going to it from my account ...also to pay back your advance they take from my checking..also great and normal ...but here's the really bad part they put my checking account in the negative by withdrawing advance..so got another advance to bring it to positive how ever this is the best part...they only advance you money on their card and you can't pay to my checking account or transfer money,2024-07-12,2

the monthly fee isn't bad for a pay day loan. But the app is old school chat not. Not AI. It roasted me for spending so much on my utilities. Like. What? Won't attach to cash app. And the referral rewards that say you can EARN BIG and get paid out ON TOP of the cash advance? LIES. it's literally just letting you get a bigger advance. Which might save you in a tough spot. But is a bad spending practice. My dad had to pay 6 dollars and doesn't need advance. Thinking I'd get REWARDED 160,2024-07-12,2

I don't understand why do I have to pay a subscription of $5.99 per month. If I had it I would need to borrow money. You should give the person an option to choose if they want to join the subscription. Or at least tell them up front before having them put their information in🤬🤬. A waste of my time.,2024-07-06,2

"I used to have zero problems with Cleo, I used it regularly and had good experiences with them. Now, after 1 simple mistake on my part with a repayment on an advance, and attempting to fix said mistake, their customer service has declined significantly. Trying to get a hold of a live person is impossible, every time I attempt to message anyone or get help, I'm ignored. On top of that, even with my balance at zero now, the app STILL claims I owe them money. I will never recommend them again.",2025-06-09,3

"Everything positive I said about Cleo is now out the windows. They NOW divide your cash advance, letting you only take out half of the full amount at a time. This practice in itself is scummy and unethical. Because instead of charging $7.99 for express once, NOW they charge express twice, getting an extra $8 out of you. Avoid at all costs. deleting my account after payday.",2025-06-09,3

"Been a member for a few years and somehow they are STILL terrible at getting the next paycheck date right. Sometimes they get it right, other times they come up with a random date then base your repayment date off that so then they want you to repay before your next paycheck even came in and you now have to clean up the mess they created, wasting your time with the useless chat bot that traps you with its useless answers rather than forwarding you to a person.

when I try to get the advance it asked to verify card number which is same card for my main direct deposit keeps saying error but the same card worked for them to take the membership fee!! but won't let me get the advance 😕 so I basically paid for a membership that I can't use!!! Then they say check your bank it's there fault well it's not bc it worked just fine for another advance app! and it worked just fine for them to take the membership fee 😡,2025-06-07,3

This app sucks. If you like being abused via text from a machine that constantly tries you to get into debt via cash advance then this is your app. If you have a clue and don't think getting into deeper debt is the way to manage your finances then avoid this silly app. I am not fond of the name Cleo either. One star is the lowest rating. Because zero stars doesn't register on anything.,2025-06-07,3
worst app ever,2025-06-07,3
Your graphics were better before! not a fan of this new beige and bland cleo..,2025-06-07,3
"Cash advances are too small like you can only get a piece of the total borrowing power they offer, the 24hr hold before getting another cash advance is super inconvenient, the instant cash transfer options are too expensive for the measly amounts you're able to advance and the idea of paying more on a subscription for a higher advance when it should be based off income is just too ridiculous to consider. I'm sure there are better options out there.",2025-06-07,3

not the greatest,2025-06-06,3
When I started getting advances they were large amounts. I pay on time or early in full. They give you less each time as a penalty and no reward for being a good customer. very disappointing. filed with better business Bureau. NOTHING HAS CHANGED. PAID 580 GOT 460 NEXT TIME 280 PAID EARLY GOT 210. SCAMMERS THEY DO NOT UPDATE THE BANK ACCOUNT ON A TIMELY MANNER AND USE WRONG FINANCIAL INFORMATION. MY MISTAKE TO PAY MY 280 THE SAME DAY AND THEN GIVEN 210. SORRY WE NEED TO LIVE ON THIS MONEY.,2025-06-06,3
soo far this is the worst app I've seen in the year you need a monthly subscription and an extra fee 5$ in the first time let you take 30$ but the charge you 20$ before that does make any sense,2025-06-06,3
I borrowed and they only give 40 dollars thats a joke and they want you to upgrade and pay more,2025-06-06,3
having to pay for a subscription to borrow money is not ideal probably for most people who are in need of a loan.,2025-06-06,3
"when I first started using cleo the app would actually help me. I was able to make some commitments to save money. The cash advances sure came in handy. I could see my own progress with becoming more financially responsible. cleo has become an app that is taking all sorts of fees from me and provides me with no service. though I've continued to receive all the same d.deposits and have all my accts connected. I've paid back my advances on time even early, but cleo has decided no more $advances.",2025-06-05,3

I don't have the patience to pay for the subscription to figure if I can get up to $250. I did accidentally hit request eligible for new amount right after I paid. It was a reflex. I borrow and pay back what I want to pay. I don't have credit cards. I feel left out because of the $10 decrease.

"in the beginning Cleo was great, but now by the time you pay you subscription fee, all you are doing is paying the interest on the $30 or $40 advance your getting and you get charged a fee to send the money to your account as well. now add all that together, and Cleo is making a killing off of us. never made it past $50 what happened to the other $200 Cleo is a joke, and then talked bad about Moneylion now that the app that helps you you should try it. it's awesome 😎",2025-06-04,3
"They took $5.99 from me and now every month but they are telling me I don't qualify for a loan because I received a bonus on top of my regular paycheck which apparently confuses ""Cleo"" and places me into an income change that affects my ability to borrow.

that sucks that you have to pick one star when they should get zero 40 days it's saying something's wrong but when I did ask Cleo they said just to wait a while I waited a whole day and it still saying it it's fraudulent because they took the 599 out of my account to pay for their stupid membership but they won't give the cash advance and they are playing games they just changed my Advance amount 2:30 instead of 40 and it's still not giving it to me saying something is wrong,2025-05-28,3
Cleo took multiple payments within a week they took 16898 on the 23rd of May and they took 16898 on the 27th of May and they took $38 for my subscription so there's a 168 98 payment too much but they took and now I have to live in my car and I can't seem to get a hold of anybody to get my money returned,2025-05-27,3

"went through 15mins or so of signing up. it sat there and said my base for borrowing was $200. then when I hit borrow it only allowed 100. then the same card they charged me on for the subscription which is capital one they wouldn't allow for borrowing. so they basically charged me their $6 for nothing. then if you cancel, they remove access right away even though you paid for a month. what SDE made this terrible design?",2025-05-23,3

hate it can't talk to a live person,2025-05-22,3
"This is a SCAM. I borrowed 150 and paid it back early. When I paid went to request another advance I was now only approved for 60 unless I upgrade the subscription to some sort of builder. Absolutely a scam. They charge 8.99 EXTRA for an express fee if u want to get the advance deposited instantly. This is on top of already having a subscription. By the time you are done paying all the fees, you have racked up a ridiculous amount of additional costs. Other advance apps DO NOT DO THIS.",2025-05-21,3

I've had a horrible experience with the Chloe app. I have paid my advances back on time. And they have not given me advances even though I have a direct deposit.

There are better options out there. I can't even speak to someone at customer service. It's probably because everyone wants a refund. Get Dave Or Earn In. Told me if I subscribe I would get a higher advance amount. The additional service was the same as the amount of my advance. What a rip off. UPDATE- Got charged another 34.00 and I finally got it cancelled problem is now I want to borrow 50 bucks and That is not an option anymore. so basically you need to pay to borrow and also still pay fees.,2025-05-13,3

sorry,2025-05-10,3
"App is ok if you need a small advance. The only thing that I have a major problem with right now, is Cleo changing their advance terms and conditions by splitting up the advance into 2 loans, then charging for the extra express fee per advance. Before this, customers used to be able to get their total advance at once, and pay one express fee. Now since Cleo changed their method and split the advance into 2, you have to pay back double the express fee! Shady!!!!!",2025-05-10,3

Plus, the app has gotten so difficult to load lately. I haven't even been able to check anything on it at all today, I keep being told ""there's been a problem"".

very misleading. For instance they say if you refer some one you was get x amount of dollars well no they just raise a borrowing limit temporarily and you pay it back. also they say you can borrow 80 huck. well you can only borrow 40 upfront then you have to wait 24hrs also you ha e very limited payback time,2025-04-27,3
"Don't apply for builder and then change your mind, my borrow amount was cut in half and hasn't changed back. Not worth having the app anymore",2025-04-27,3
"Huge warning: Only two weeks into the current month's paid subscription, they already charged me for an additional month that I would not need. AI chatbot will not refund you for the extra month you're not even in because you're still in the month you got a cash withdrawal. All that is paid back and done, I do not need another month of Cleo Plus. It took about 15 minutes to get to real customer service agent and get them to refund me. You pay Plus subscription + big withdrawal fees for advances.",2025-04-26,3
I was charged twice this month for the subscription fee 04/12 and 04/24 when I should be charge once a month. I will be calling my bank for my money back and cancel my subscription.,2025-04-25,3

App has nothing but issues. Advances were nice. was unable to access virtual card info as the info screen constantly froze the app. got the card after about 10 days but cannot even activate due to the app freezing.. will update if I get help.,2025-04-24,3

"Making you take an $80 advance out as $40 and $40 so you get hit with a $7 fee BOTH times for 1 advance? So $14 for your whole advance, plus $15 a month? That is why I use Cleo the least, only if I've already used Dave, Empower, and Brigit, usually 1 or 2 of the reasonable apps is good enough.",2025-04-18,3
it keeps saying my payment for cleo plus failed. it did not and it came out of my account. it keeps trying to make me pay the 5.99 again but it keeps failing even though I have money in my checking account. it won't let me re borrow because it keeps saying I'm not subscribed to cleo plus. please fix this. also the AI tool is absolutely useless!,2025-04-16,3
I deleted because it said l owed n l payed it back way before the due date got it on my bank statement to prove it. l will try again maybe they fixed the problem. well now another problem l can't login in trying to connect bank info n it's frozen still frozen uninstall n reinstall no better! clean gets no stars in my experience,2025-04-16,3
what do you connect to? my bank kept saying your credentials wrong and I changed my password two times and it still didn't work,2025-04-15,3
Misleading,2025-04-14,3
Cleo is off the free money Friday sweepstakes ends on may30th and she said we will be notified on March 14th which is a month ago and them she said I was right it's may 7th that's 2 weeks before it ends. If she can't get a simple date correct how are we supposed to trust anything within the cleo app? This is our money not just some game or something it's our MONEY...what else has she been wrong on or with this is scary especially dealing with out lively hood! Something is definitely not right!,2025-04-11,3
ok,2025-04-11,3
keep asking for my card that never arrived and you bot system sucks,2025-04-11,3
I was renewing my membership after my advance was paid back now it's saying my card don't work? Which I have money on both accounts? It was working fine. I like the app but if going do this type of stuff I'm not going use it.,2025-04-10,3
hasn't cleared what I owe when it been paid for,2025-04-10,3
"Eligibility is very inconsistent. AI chat bot, although intuitive and somewhat impressive is unable to provide what I would consider to be acceptable reasons for changes in cash advance eligibility.

I decided to quit while I'm ahead, cancel and uninstall.",2025-04-10,3

the point of a cash advance is cause im broke till payday not cause I have all bit of money and need more,2025-03-29,3
It won't take my subscription payment so I can get a advance,2025-03-27,3
This app is good but they RECHARGE you 3 times..! I had a friend tell me bout this app I used it in Feb I borrowed $50 for a bill but ATM I was unemployed so I had too keep changing my repay dates so fast forward too March 25th they took out $20 then notice they took out additional $26.99 THEN additional $5.99 .. I don't know where the $26.99 came from I asked the company about they said that was they express fee price so then I notice my receipt the express fee was $6. TODAY THEY DID IT AGAIN!,2025-03-26,3
"if I need a cash advance, then I prbly don't have extra $$ sitting there for a monthly subscription I just put my last $7 in the tank, now you want $5.99 why don't you set up that first payment to come out of the cash advance??",2025-03-26,3
Used to work generally well but the most recent update broke the app with constant pop-ups about in app tasks that come up random as you're trying to do something. App still functions but very close to being unusable and has become an atrocious user experience.,2025-03-21,3
Lousy customer support. Chat bots are limited. Repayment date is 2 weeks,2025-03-17,3
I changed my review because it will not let me link my bank card to get an advance but it let me put it for a subscription which makes no sense,2025-03-15,3
Add cash function stopped working. Almost impossible to get customer support.,2025-03-12,3
"Cute app and idea but it is way to random with advance eligibility. Example It let me advance $65 out of $130 saying that was the daily limit, I took out the $65 then now the other half disappeared and can't take anything out until its paid. Another time it let me take out $120 one paycheck and when I paid it back on time with the same direct deposit amount it only let me take out $40 for next pay period. Customer service said they had no idea why",2025-03-11,3
Not good . Cleo gave me advance for 7 months and I changed banks and they stopped giving them to me ( and I was paying the highest subscription) and I still can't get one. I also referred kelley McClain and never even got 5.00 for referring a friend,2025-03-10,3
Was great at first then after they took the second payment now the app doesn't work,2025-03-10,3
I'm hoping for good luck let's see how it goes,2025-03-06,3
Has features but even with my 700+ credit score and paying they're $40 bundle only allotted $30 to borrow.,2025-03-02,3
They play games with your advanced. U can't talk to a human. Cleo will make changes to your account without notice. Then I won't get another advance but they will take your money for a subscription u can't use. Only to make u upgrade and pay more. Bad all around.,2025-03-01,3
They are a joke !,2025-03-01,3

For the past 3 days I have been getting charged $5.00 &$5.89 twice a day and when I tried to talk to your chat it didn't understand me and now today I can't get into my account it's like I started all over again.

For once in my life they need to fix an app where when they ask you about what your issue is that you can give your actual issue to them yourself instead of having a multiple choice about what you're wanting to say cuz that's not helping the matters none at all anyways hopefully this review reaches someone that can reach out to me because I'm having issues contacting them I'm having issues with the documents because my bank account is paperless I cannot do a screenshot on a paperless account,2025-02-11,3

"Well, first, you have to subscribe, and that costs $5.99, so if your flat-out broke, this app won't help you. Second, they charge you fees on top of the subscriptions to get the money instantly.

This app is not what they say for while it was cool then I payed attention to thy where making double pay my subscription then not allowing me to get my other have my advance til the first advance was paid or you pay your subscription and still nothing now I'm canceling my whole subscription because they're say I didn't pay it even when I'm showing.

So the app was great and it truly helped me out when I was in a jam but I just want people to know I subscribed to a 3 month agreement and they gave me a 30$ bost for any future advances but they also told me to apply for their card and I did and when I was going through the steps they offered a promotion which I needed to complete some task in 30days and I would get even more advances in the future. The app logged me out and it doesn't exist. Customer service basically said nothing we can do.,2025-01-01,3

"The app promises you can get an advance up to $500, but you have to pay up front for the subscription and that is the only way to get an advance. If one reads the fine print, the advance promised can range from $2- $250, so long as you dont have any outstanding advanced. That is why you have to pay up front for the dubscription, because after you pay the $14.99 your advance may only be $5, so youd actually lose $10 first month and be stuck owing every month after.

Your advertisement online seems deceptive. The black guy says you can borrow 80 and that's all you pay back and we all know that's not true nothing's for free. You also say that you get the advance immediately and that's not the case I had to wait a day for it if I'm taking out an advantage it's because I need it right there and then so that was disappointing.,2024-12-03,3

If u do by chance get a human, they claim to not be in control of Cleo, that she cannot be fixed on their end. Not cool, Cleo.",2024-11-16,3
"This app sucks sometimes. They don't let the other amount come to your bank account. It say's processing or something like that untill you have to pay it back. You only get one advance, I should say. It works when it wants, I should say that also.",2024-11-15,3
Still sucks,2024-11-15,3

Not really helpful. They decide how little you can borrow for 15 days..,2024-11-02,3
In my experience this app hasn't been helpful. I opened it awhile ago then closed it and reopened some time later using a different account. The advances (40$ btw) keep going to the old account I disconnected! Now payment is due when I never actually received the advance. Theirs no way to get actual assistance on this app from a human not a bot!,2024-10-31,3

The app is like a loop and takes you on a desperate ride to looking for answers which are not at all forthcoming in the chat option.

They really need to work on this.,2024-10-17,3
I haven't been able to borrow anything even though it says that I am eligible. Says that I can get my credit score for no charge. I have tried to get my credit score twice and both times I have been unable to get it. The app just wants me to. Upgrade to the paid version. 2 stars was probably 2 stars too many,2024-10-16,3
The app is very easy to access. But you can get a loan pay it back early or put back on time and you're still going to get the same amount as last time or maybe even lower. And on top of that it only uses one of my accounts when I can't understand why they don't use Cashspps account because that's where a lot of my money comes from so they got stuff a little backwards,2024-10-12,3
Advance are not enough get bigger Advance other places once get chance leaving,2024-10-10,3
To be honest it's OK for a quick few bucks in a hurry but the amounts you can borrow always change and they never go up they always go down they want you to subscribe to get more or invite friends but they charge a fee for borrowing anyways so why have a different subscription when you already pay for one the highest I was able to borrow was 90 now it's down to 75 even though I pay it back on time most times even early makes no sense,2024-10-10,3
Have to pay fee before you can see the advance amount. And the fee to advance ratio is nearly twice as much as other options. Waste of 5.99,2024-10-10,3

"I have had Cleo several months. I have taken out a small amt on payday and repaid it and have never missed or been late. Two weeks ago, after repaying, it told me I was ineligible for a new one.

Defeats the purpose of getting the app for an advance when needed, if you are not going to get the amount you need. I do not endorse or recommend getting or using this app for cash advances. It is a waste and a huge letdown. Don't be fooled. Pay attention to the reviews!",2024-09-21,3
Good app,2024-09-20,3
Well this app an I had some ups an downs some was my fault some was they fault but the difference is I corrected my wrongs they have yet to do so I could a bunch of negative facts but they helped me so I won't I'm still trying to work with them but when you ask to speak to a person an the A.I bot says no ppl here. You better believe them.. Dealing with finances an you gt get a am A.I bot THEY DO THAT.,2024-09-19,3
Sucks,2024-09-17,3
The reminders for the payment are really annoying and the fact that y'all try to take out a few days before renewal is really annoying. I won't be using this app again.,2024-09-15,3
So I decided to give app a try and I can now say they have made a great app! Everything works like it should and is easy to use!,2024-09-14,3

"The fact that I (accidentally) paid $6 for a subscription service, only to be allowed to transfer $30 at most to my bank is disappointing. I've used other loan apps that allow you to borrow more than double that amount WITHOUT a subscription service.

"They gave me the advance, and I paid back early, every advance I got, which was 6 of them, they said would help my odds of getting another advance. my income hasn't changed, I haven't changed any spending habits, and they cut me off for advances, and I have no idea why.

I have been waiting for almost 2 weeks to use that increase on that loan!😤NO CARD,NO $!!!Once my membership is over I'm going to cancel that credit card!!

Dave only charge $1/mth for Subscription.",2024-07-23,3

Well started out great then convinced me to do the card thing still haven't received the card but money going to it from my account ...also to pay back your advance they take from my checking..also great and normal ...but here's the really bad part they put my checking account in the negative by withdrawing advance..so got another advance to bring it to positive how ever this is the best part...they only advance you money on their card and you can't pay to my checking account or transfer money,2024-07-12,3
"Too much trying to convince one to subscribe to at least ONE of their ""perks""...and not really helping with the root of why we downloaded this app.",2024-07-12,3
the monthly fee isn't bad for a pay day loan. But the app is old school chat not. Not AI. It roasted me for spending so much on my utilities. Like. What? Won't attach to cash app. And the referral rewards that say you can EARN BIG and get paid out ON TOP of the cash advance? LIES. it's literally just letting you get a bigger advance. Which might save you in a tough spot. But is a bad spending practice. My dad had to pay 6 dollars and doesn't need advance. Thinking I'd get REWARDED 160,2024-07-12,3

They significantly decreased my advance (even though I paid my advance before the due date) and now they want more money/month for a subscription. Who is going to pay MORE money for a smaller advance or no advance at all?! Just another site/app full of lies to take your money every chance they can!",2024-07-10,3
I don't understand why do I have to pay a subscription of $5.99 per month. If I had it I would need to borrow money. You should give the person an option to choose if they want to join the subscription. Or at least tell them up front before having them put their information in🤬🤬. A waste of my time.,2024-07-06,3
No good for anything except collecting their monthly subscription fees. If you wanna give away money get Cleo.,2024-07-02,3

Why would they only take a partial payment out? I'm left to ask strangers for a few $$.",2024-06-13,3
Didn't have an issue with their cash advance for months I always re paid the advances on time. Just repayed an advance on time the money was taken out of my account but the app says my payment is overdue which will effect how much I can borrow next time.

What a joke don't waste your time with this app.,2024-06-11,3

The purpose was to have more money not less for Zero reason. This will be my last time using this app. Now we have $30 less to work with which was basically all our grocery money. Thanks. My son appreciates it.",2024-06-07,3

Do not get your check deposit through here the only way to transfer money is to take it out of the atm It will not use its own card to pay back the money it lends you You cant use it to add to cash app or even paypal.

I've used this app for over a year and now it's acting up. Shouldn't the eligibility check include everything including these state laws?

However there is no place for me to enter the problem. Also the app crashes all the time. It crashed six times in an hour.",2024-03-31,3
"Compared to similar cash advance apps, it rates low for me. Firstly, is the monthly fee of minimum $5.99 - maximum $15-16. Secondly, is the inability to see how much you are approved for to even determine if the app is worth the advance. I'm less likely to sign up if I don't know what I'm going to receive.

But not just when I open the app, like every few seconds that message pops up. It works and I've gotten plenty of advanced but it's extremely annoying that it constantly lags and that app not responding message pops up repeatedly. I can't think of why it would. I had an iPhone and the app worked perfectly. I switched to a razr 2024 plus and Ive had this problem ever sense",2025-03-06,3

"Works great when it works. I do like the Builder card. However, recently, the app won't sync with my bank. I go through Plaid and sign in.

No error message or anything explaining what happened, just a white screen. It's rather frustrating.",2025-02-24,3

It's a frustrating process,2025-02-15,3
I don't understand why my advance amounts are always very low. It is the lowest of all my apps. . Crazy to be offered $400 with Dave and only $40 thru Cleo. . And I am a long time customer. . I do not think it updates connected accounts often. . Doesn't seem worth it to upgrade to builder,2025-02-13,3

Cleo is an okay app. I was looking for an app that would tell me how much is a reasonable amount to save with the amount of income and expenses I currently have. Not sure cleo does it for me but I just downloaded so I'll give it some time.,2025-02-06,3

CONS: •Advance never goes up even with early or on time payment •Slow responces (AI chat is the runaround) •Constant issues with pin number transactions (always says invalid pin even if THEY reset it) •Excessive unnecessary notifications •Can't add account to most apps or banks •Too many technical issues •Identity verification is just weird and suspicious as HECK -- PROS: •Advance with low interest •Instant bank transfer with no fees •Credit building •Convenient savings options •Easy to manage,2025-01-19,3

This app keeps going to a blank white screen every time I try to pay for my subscription but had no issues when it came to repaying what I barrowed,2025-01-09,3
I am able to get a small advance if hard times occur. I don't like that they choose a repayment date instead of allowing me to insert the next pay period. 😒 In some ppl circumstances that could cause negative balance if it's not available the date they want which defeats the purpose of help on advance charging up front.,2025-01-06,3

There's nothing to tell it's the same as all the other financial institutions,2024-12-22,3
I was genuinely happy with the Cleo app it's one of the few that you can get cash advances without having a direct deposit paycheck in your but after I had a friend referral that signed up even though none of my information changed all the sudden I am not a eligible to get a cash advance for this week. Which makes absolutely no sense the customer service can't make heads or tails of it so I really don't know what's going on with it. Once this is fixed I'd be happy to give this 5 Stars,2024-12-21,3
Eh,2024-12-21,3
Advance is low but it's not bad overall,2024-12-21,3

I love the fact that you can talk to the app it's actually fun.,2024-10-03,3
Has really helped me in a bind.also seeing the spending that I didn't need to spend was an eye opener. But the fact that if you pay on time and pay off early doesn't help you get a bigger advance you never can make it to the 250 or high advance that's fir sure plus keeps deleting my cards I have saved for prepayment draft .,2024-09-26,3
It's ok but I pay back before the date or on the date then my advance amount drops that's crazy,2024-09-26,3

Started using about 2 months ago and really liked this app. Then somehow my pay back dated was changed to a date right before pay day. I wasn't able to pay back til the next day. So now they won't give me what I usually get because of something they did,2024-09-04,3
I've used Cleo before and stopped. It would only let me get $20 and I also have to pay 5.99 a month. Got in a real bind. Decided to go back to it and it said I was approved for $60. But I tried to change my card and it wouldn't let me so my only option was to get it send to my account which would take 3-5 days. I'll have my paycheck by then. Charged me the $5.99 wouldn't let me change my card and while I was trying to change my card it went down to $20 offer. Now I see why I left Cleo alone,2024-09-03,3

This app denied me advance but still charged my account 599 and I disputed it with my card company,2024-04-15,3
"I usually love this card I loved it so much that I transferred my direct deposit to this card before realizing that I cannot send money, I can't pay for things online, it keeps crashing when I go to look at my details on my credit card and now I can't use other services like cash app because I don't have a debit card to link it to",2024-04-07,3
"When I first got this app it allowed me to borrow I paid back and now I can't borrow but whatever reason I get over $1,200 in my account a month even if I overdrafted my account in my regular account is in the negative I always pay back I've had my bank account since 2016 but for some reason that's not enough for Cleo",2024-04-07,3

Reason being: Cleo's team recently reached out to me for a call/interview to gain insight as to why I stopped their direct deposits. This shows initiative to identify possible issues and an interest in their consumers satisfaction with the app, so for that, I will give Cleo a raise. Thanks for the time, much appreciated.",2024-03-19,3

you know you guys are scam you are for a cash advance but only if I subscribe to some plan to give you guys money to pay for that plan but why would I need a cash advance if I had money to pay for a plan the plan costs more than what an advanced you would give me would be,2025-06-12,4
they take out unexplained fees over and over and claim it's partial repayment even though they take it way before due date and they never deduct what they take from the balance and there's no way to contact them other than the useless AI chat bot that doesn't understand anything and answers no questions and keeps telling you to contact customer support when the bot is the only customer support they have,2025-06-12,4

very fishy business,2025-05-30,4
app promised 500.00 of you sign up for 15.99 fee I did it offered only 20 without agreeing to anything I issued me a save credit card and put the 20 dollar advance on that. I demanded cancelation of advance and cancel subscription effective immediately and issue refund for the 15.99. no human contact only email they will respond in 7 days I was told to contact on social media but like Cleo app it's an AI automated response with no help. WARNING this info isnt provided until after paying 15.99,2025-05-30,4

"This app boasts about being a money building app. They are never accurate with your bank balance. Usually 2-3 days behind. What really did me in was my repayment of 500 dollars. I was planning on borrowing 250 because I'm trying to not depend on the app. 500 dollars out of a check is a big chunk no matter who you are, so I was depending on 250ish. Well they offered me 75 measly dollars. How is anyone supposed to survive off of that?! So to claim they help with your finances is the biggest lie...",2025-05-29,4

"Wants you to subscribe and pay $6 immediately before you can even start to use it or see what amount you can borrow. from what I see you then pay at least $9 to get whatever small amount they offer you if anything, which is already more than my overdraft fee, so I didn't go through with it. I have other apps like this and they have free trials or charge at the end of a month, not right off the bat at installation. bye.",2025-05-29,4
"very bad compared to others takes forever to reach customers service, they can never get subscription fees correct , takes hrs. days to make a adjustment",2025-05-29,4
extremely expensive to use for almost no advance. impossible to change bank accounts. would be easier and less expensive to find a loan shark.,2025-05-29,4
"these people are a SCAM. I paid their way overpriced fee for their credit builder card (u can get the same thing for free from numerous bank) so I could qualify for these ""boosts"", paid back their loan early, then when i desperately need them, all of a sudden im not eligible.. so they show u this amount that they will loan u, but won't actually give it to u. says low account balance. if I had a bunch of money on hand why would I need an advance til payday? they are SCAM don't trust them. ...",2025-05-29,4

it's a lie.,2025-05-28,4
They lie just to get your info and then they don't help you I paid my advance back and have the receipt Cleo sent me showing I paided it but they all they want is to connect to my bank and they will see if I paid..but they won't take there own receipt that they sent me ..what's the use of the receipt if y'all ain't gonna honor it...fake people and I am reporting this app...,2025-05-28,4
poor customer service. nobody helps or answers questions. I will not recommend Cleo to anyone,2025-05-28,4
that sucks that you have to pick one star when they should get zero 40 days it's saying something's wrong but when I did ask Cleo they said just to wait a while I waited a whole day and it still saying it it's fraudulent because they took the 599 out of my account to pay for their stupid membership but they won't give the cash advance and they are playing games they just changed my Advance amount 2:30 instead of 40 and it's still not giving it to me saying something is wrong,2025-05-28,4
Cleo took multiple payments within a week they took 16898 on the 23rd of May and they took 16898 on the 27th of May and they took $38 for my subscription so there's a 168 98 payment too much but they took and now I have to live in my car and I can't seem to get a hold of anybody to get my money returned,2025-05-27,4
got be careful with this app it will randomly steal money from you.,2025-05-27,4
they do not respond to you they have a robot The robot is very disrespectful The robot will not answer your questions only what they feel like they will answer only what they feel they can handle Cleo doesn't have a direct contact so when you do put your money in be prepared to only be able to withdraw through the ATM you cannot put it on any other platform to transfer money that is what they're not going to tell you when you go in to the Western Union it doesn't accept it's a lot of places this,2025-05-27,4
It caused me money I tried to borrow and it took my money from my account and also the 30 they gave me so it left me stuck short of cash and I still dont have my refund its been three days my next step is to contact bbb and report the company no way it should take this long to refund my money back to my card my money for my gas back and forth to work I had to borrow money from family because of this its frustrating cant talk to no one only a computer this is bad business no understanding,2025-05-27,4
"Theyre constantly changing the amount you can borrow even though nothing on my side changes, whether it's my spending or my income. I even finished one of their ""challenges"" this week to improve my eligibility for cash advance... and it was literally cut in half AFTER I manually paid it back on time.

Also, physical card never showed; it also states in the app that it was never delivered.",2025-05-25,4

There are better options out there. I can't even speak to someone at customer service. It's probably because everyone wants a refund. Get Dave Or Earn In. Told me if I subscribe I would get a higher advance amount. The additional service was the same as the amount of my advance. What a rip off. UPDATE- Got charged another 34.00 and I finally got it cancelled problem is now I want to borrow 50 bucks and That is not an option anymore. so basically you need to pay to borrow and also still pay fees.,2025-05-13,4

get charged twice and can't reach an actual person this is a scam,2025-05-11,4
"Cleo is connected to my backing account to make payments, but it states that it is not connected to my bank account to send cash advance to me.",2025-05-11,4
sucks falsely let's u know what u available to borrow,2025-05-11,4
waste of time,2025-05-10,4
sorry,2025-05-10,4
"App is ok if you need a small advance. The only thing that I have a major problem with right now, is Cleo changing their advance terms and conditions by splitting up the advance into 2 loans, then charging for the extra express fee per advance. Before this, customers used to be able to get their total advance at once, and pay one express fee. Now since Cleo changed their method and split the advance into 2, you have to pay back double the express fee! Shady!!!!!",2025-05-10,4
Cleo has hijacked my account and making it near impossible to sign in and get them out.,2025-05-10,4
I was loving this app but now I don't like it because it will not open with the right login credentials,2025-05-10,4
requires an upfront subscription,2025-05-10,4
"this app is horrible, I have Link my account quite a few times 😕.. I'm just going to cancel it",2025-05-10,4
"App says there was a problem with my advance and I need to ""talk to our humans"" but there's no way to do that and the AI chat just keeps giving me the same irrelevant messages over and over.",2025-05-10,4
insane. they want you to pay in order to borrow with no guarantee that you can borrow,2025-05-09,4
Never been late or missed a payment in years! They take away 400 of advance amount with no warning! Horrible CS! Can never get a real person on the phone!,2025-05-09,4
"app won't stay connected to bank account, can't get any help.",2025-05-09,4
Terrible app. they never really give you an advance.,2025-05-08,4
I canceled my subscription and they still took money out account and refused to refund it,2025-05-08,4
cant connect supported bank and now cant rec code sent to email. What a joke.,2025-05-08,4
This is app is AWFUL. Do not try to get an advance through them. They either TAKE your money for Cleo plus nd never pay you or overcharge for a cash advance repayment. 0/10,2025-05-08,4
signed up was supposed to have access to a certain amount talking made me sign up for 14.99 a month with a guarantee of a $30 increase on my cash advance then got told I'd have to put $30 in every month to have that $30 so I canceled the 1499 a month and it won't let me use any of it if they bill me $14.99 a month still after I canceled it I will come after them,2025-05-08,4
No real person to answer questions,2025-05-08,4
they never gave me the other cash advance that there lieing about,2025-05-07,4
does not do job I still don't get any money from it all a waste of time and I tack money for other accounts,2025-05-07,4
the reload advance option doesn't work anymore.,2025-05-06,4
"App used to be decent, now it all just feels like a scam. I'm eligible for $300, but I can only take up to $100 per 24 hours, and if I want it quicker I have to pay the 8 dollar fee for each transaction. That's AFTER paying the monthly fee. Plus, the app has gotten so difficult to load lately. I haven't even been able to check anything on it at all today, I keep being told ""there's been a problem"". I think this app is on it's way out the door, and I'm deleting. There are way better options.",2025-05-06,4
it's garbage. I was a customer with no problem. I have try to reactivate and they took my subscription money but refuse to give me an advance. they don't deserve a half star‼️ I AM SICK OF CONVERSING WITH A COMPUTER‼️,2025-05-06,4
never got the advance after meeting all qualifications,2025-06-11,4
too much Rio raff.,2025-06-11,4
"I’ve been using this banking app for a while, but recently the experience has become extremely frustrating. The app regularly fails to load the dashboard and often shows a “No Connection” error, even when my phone has full signal and other apps are working fine. It crashes frequently and won’t allow me to view my account balance or transactions. This has made it very difficult to stay on top of my finances, and I’ve had to consider using other methods just to access my account. I’ve reached out",2025-06-09,4

tried it. terrible compared to others. a monthly fee and up to $9 to pull out and only 100 per day. Earnin is better,2025-06-07,4
I have paid for the $14.99 subscription and cant do anything on the app. It just keeps loading. It's not letting me add anything. Im pissed,2025-06-07,4

"The app Use to work fine, but bow it won't log me in at all a s freezes up",2025-06-05,4
There has been a recent rebrand of Cleo. The logo went from blue to brown. Which is apporiate as the app has now crapped out. I've had to reinstall several times. Cleo please look into this. it's very confusing to a customer who had a high opinion of your services but now......not so much.,2025-06-05,4
It let's you borrow so much then when you pay it back then it only let's you borrow half the next time. So annoying,2025-06-04,4
after using Cleo for months I have realized there support system is bugged and the people running it are inactive,2025-06-04,4
"I rated you at 5 stars before this last update. The worst part was the sudden removal of the life saving ""reload"" function. Maybe I'm being selfish but a little warning would have been great. It put me in a bad spot for sure. Everything else is good tho. #bringbackblue",2025-06-03,4
they try to use my debit for the repayment it was on hold cause to much activity so the bank put a hold on it and now I have2×103.98 and 2× 43.98 and 1× 13.98 all pending from my account,2025-06-03,4

"closing my account. but when I used it, it sure came in handy. for some reason though it didn't really work all that well with my Motorola razr and would constantly freeze up. never once did that when I had a Samsung. the only other thing I didn't like was that it was slow to move money from my bank to the save hacks and savings account that I started in the app. it would give you money quickly, but not the other way around if that makes sense",2025-06-02,4
"loved the app, but now that I no longer need it, it will not let me unsubscribe.. stuck in an endless loop trying to cancel",2025-05-31,4
Took the subscription out of my account. and didn't refund the money or allowed me to borrow. it's cool. Have a great day!!!,2025-05-30,4
I got a message from Cleo AI saying that there was $339 that went to my account then where is it it's not in my account,2025-05-30,4
This app has been double charging me. I have 2 bank accounts listed with them. They will charge one account and then on the same day it charges my other account for the same thing. when I tried to get ahold of customer service or a actual person. I can't find a phone number or email and the AI just keeps sending me in circles but never help.,2025-05-30,4
id give it more stars but I can't reach a human customer service agent. so you get 2! I'm very upset with Cleo. I repaid what I owed and your app is trying to charge me double. I have proof in my bank statements. I can send you a screenshot. but this is ridiculous. I'm disappointed in Cleo!,2025-05-28,4
Can't set up account and can't never get a loan,2025-05-28,4
I've been trying to get my advance for 3 days. I'm now re-downloading the app to see if it will load. I get to the last screen all is good and than boom won't load. idk what's up.,2025-05-27,4
can I get no assistance to help me with error message,2025-05-27,4
"I get very tired of the app trying to bully me. If I have money deposited it notifies me with a jab about not giving it all to Uber. I am visually impaired and don't drive! Also it harasses me about the Builder card. For years I've said I don't want it. The pressure has mellowed some. before it was rude, pushy, and belligerent. I don't care about games. I already know what I spend my money on. I use the app for advances and would prefer to only use it for that.",2025-05-27,4
they are all up in your buss telling you how to spend your money.,2025-05-26,4
it's saying I didn't pay my advance but it took it out of my account,2025-05-26,4
"Cleo said I get an advance of $60, then allows me to only get half at a time. my first $30 said it was sent by Cleo but hasn't showed up on my statement, and all charges from that date already settled. then they allowed me the other $30, and expect me to pay back $60, even though I've been back and forth between them and the bank. I am frustrated and I'm not paying back what I never got.",2025-05-25,4
Getting help is atrocious. Have to deal with a limited bot. No way to talk with real person on issues the dang bot can't or will not help with.,2025-05-21,4
I cannot add my bank card and there is no human help,2025-05-21,4
"I used to like this app, until they straight played me. I had been a loyal user and built my way up to several hundred dollar advance. It even had a message that said I would be getting an extra $100 on my next advance. I paid my advance back the day before it was due and was suddenly only eligible for $80. No change to income or spending habits, no explanation, just hundreds of dollars gone and not able to be drawn back out. I'm not even sure what happened to that extra $100 I was eligible for?",2025-05-19,4
"I already have this with Cash App, and I get 4% interest. I don't have to pay Cash App a monthly fee.",2025-05-18,4

you can't get the card unless linking your bank account,2025-05-14,4
"App not working properly - Doesn't send login code to email, also gets stuck on determining eligibility. I just repaid you guys today!! Totally disappointed- you guys are playing with my money at this point",2025-05-13,4
it is so hard to reach a actual person when you have questions that need answers and the fake Bot shows up. that's why I changed my rating,2025-05-12,4
it took my money and i cant access my money or anything it glitches and moves and jumps around,2025-05-11,4
really sucks,2025-05-10,4
it won't let me withdraw the money that I saved,2025-05-10,4
you shouldn't have to subscribe and pay a fee to get advances.,2025-05-10,4
it's a joke. refuses giving a refund for being overcharged no real person to speak to and in all honesty I wouldn't recommend it to ANYONE,2025-05-08,4
pay subscription ND still can't get a advance. why pay anything for nothing?,2025-05-07,4
it will help you if your in a bind but it's been almost a week now that it says it automatically took a repayment out my account yet still says I owe money,2025-05-06,4
Every time I use this app it keeps crashing. A box with a message pops up saying close the app or wait. it's getting pretty annoying.,2025-05-06,4
"HOW DO YOU DAY RIP OFF!!!! 🤔The app seems to offer some helpful tools for credit building, saving money and spending but at the cost of what the app is charging for it's services is not worth it being as how you have other apps that exist to offer the same tools for less or at no cost at all like ""CHIME"", ""EMPOWER"" and ""DAVE"". ""CLEO"" charging you $5.99 monthly for the app might not be a lot to some but then your offering you to borrow money at $5.99 PER ADVANCE. NOT WORTH IT! 🤔🧐",2025-05-02,4
I have asked 3 times to cancel my subscription you keep saying May24 I would like it cancelled now. I will not be responsible for any charged after today May 1st,2025-05-02,4
"the app is inconsistent with the amount you can borrow. due to the amount not staying the same each time, it can out you in terrible debt and do more harm then help. cleo how are you going to let me borrow 300, and then cut it back to 150? rude and inconvenient.",2025-05-01,4

app needs immediate addressing.. i cannot login because when i try to type the code sent to my email the app is not allowing me to even get to my keyboard. and I've always payed my advances on time so this is pretty annoying. So hopefully you address that issue cause how am i supposed to pay when i cannot even get in.,2025-04-28,4
very misleading. For instance they say if you refer some one you was get x amount of dollars well no they just raise a borrowing limit temporarily and you pay it back. also they say you can borrow 80 huck. well you can only borrow 40 upfront then you have to wait 24hrs also you ha e very limited payback time,2025-04-27,4
"Don't apply for builder and then change your mind, my borrow amount was cut in half and hasn't changed back. Not worth having the app anymore",2025-04-27,4
"Huge warning: Only two weeks into the current month's paid subscription, they already charged me for an additional month that I would not need. AI chatbot will not refund you for the extra month you're not even in because you're still in the month you got a cash withdrawal. All that is paid back and done, I do not need another month of Cleo Plus. It took about 15 minutes to get to real customer service agent and get them to refund me. You pay Plus subscription + big withdrawal fees for advances.",2025-04-26,4
I was charged twice this month for the subscription fee 04/12 and 04/24 when I should be charge once a month. I will be calling my bank for my money back and cancel my subscription.,2025-04-25,4
hard with cash adbance,2025-04-25,4

takes forever and accomplish nothing,2025-04-21,4
"Making you take an $80 advance out as $40 and $40 so you get hit with a $7 fee BOTH times for 1 advance? So $14 for your whole advance, plus $15 a month? That is why I use Cleo the least, only if I've already used Dave, Empower, and Brigit, usually 1 or 2 of the reasonable apps is good enough.",2025-04-18,4
it keeps saying my payment for cleo plus failed. it did not and it came out of my account. it keeps trying to make me pay the 5.99 again but it keeps failing even though I have money in my checking account. it won't let me re borrow because it keeps saying I'm not subscribed to cleo plus. please fix this. also the AI tool is absolutely useless!,2025-04-16,4
I deleted because it said l owed n l payed it back way before the due date got it on my bank statement to prove it. l will try again maybe they fixed the problem. well now another problem l can't login in trying to connect bank info n it's frozen still frozen uninstall n reinstall no better! clean gets no stars in my experience,2025-04-16,4
what do you connect to? my bank kept saying your credentials wrong and I changed my password two times and it still didn't work,2025-04-15,4
Misleading,2025-04-14,4
Cleo is off the free money Friday sweepstakes ends on may30th and she said we will be notified on March 14th which is a month ago and them she said I was right it's may 7th that's 2 weeks before it ends. If she can't get a simple date correct how are we supposed to trust anything within the cleo app? This is our money not just some game or something it's our MONEY...what else has she been wrong on or with this is scary especially dealing with out lively hood! Something is definitely not right!,2025-04-11,4
ok,2025-04-11,4
keep asking for my card that never arrived and you bot system sucks,2025-04-11,4
I was renewing my membership after my advance was paid back now it's saying my card don't work? Which I have money on both accounts? It was working fine. I like the app but if going do this type of stuff I'm not going use it.,2025-04-10,4
hasn't cleared what I owe when it been paid for,2025-04-10,4
"Eligibility is very inconsistent. AI chat bot, although intuitive and somewhat impressive is unable to provide what I would consider to be acceptable reasons for changes in cash advance eligibility.

I decided to quit while I'm ahead, cancel and uninstall.",2025-04-10,4
This app got off to a great Start. What turned me off was how the app AI became annoying by snooping through my accounts and making little Sarcastic remarks about my spending habits.,2025-04-08,4

It won't take my subscription payment so I can get a advance,2025-03-27,4
This app is good but they RECHARGE you 3 times..! I had a friend tell me bout this app I used it in Feb I borrowed $50 for a bill but ATM I was unemployed so I had too keep changing my repay dates so fast forward too March 25th they took out $20 then notice they took out additional $26.99 THEN additional $5.99 .. I don't know where the $26.99 came from I asked the company about they said that was they express fee price so then I notice my receipt the express fee was $6. TODAY THEY DID IT AGAIN!,2025-03-26,4
"if I need a cash advance, then I prbly don't have extra $$ sitting there for a monthly subscription I just put my last $7 in the tank, now you want $5.99 why don't you set up that first payment to come out of the cash advance??",2025-03-26,4
Used to work generally well but the most recent update broke the app with constant pop-ups about in app tasks that come up random as you're trying to do something. App still functions but very close to being unusable and has become an atrocious user experience.,2025-03-21,4
Lousy customer support. Chat bots are limited. Repayment date is 2 weeks,2025-03-17,4
I changed my review because it will not let me link my bank card to get an advance but it let me put it for a subscription which makes no sense,2025-03-15,4
Add cash function stopped working. Almost impossible to get customer support.,2025-03-12,4
"Cute app and idea but it is way to random with advance eligibility. Example It let me advance $65 out of $130 saying that was the daily limit, I took out the $65 then now the other half disappeared and can't take anything out until its paid. Another time it let me take out $120 one paycheck and when I paid it back on time with the same direct deposit amount it only let me take out $40 for next pay period. Customer service said they had no idea why",2025-03-11,4
Not good . Cleo gave me advance for 7 months and I changed banks and they stopped giving them to me ( and I was paying the highest subscription) and I still can't get one. I also referred kelley McClain and never even got 5.00 for referring a friend,2025-03-10,4
Was great at first then after they took the second payment now the app doesn't work,2025-03-10,4
I'm hoping for good luck let's see how it goes,2025-03-06,4
Has features but even with my 700+ credit score and paying they're $40 bundle only allotted $30 to borrow.,2025-03-02,4
They play games with your advanced. U can't talk to a human. Cleo will make changes to your account without notice. Then I won't get another advance but they will take your money for a subscription u can't use. Only to make u upgrade and pay more. Bad all around.,2025-03-01,4
They are a joke !,2025-03-01,4
Better than Brigit but still not great.,2025-02-25,4

For the past 3 days I have been getting charged $5.00 &$5.89 twice a day and when I tried to talk to your chat it didn't understand me and now today I can't get into my account it's like I started all over again.

For once in my life they need to fix an app where when they ask you about what your issue is that you can give your actual issue to them yourself instead of having a multiple choice about what you're wanting to say cuz that's not helping the matters none at all anyways hopefully this review reaches someone that can reach out to me because I'm having issues contacting them I'm having issues with the documents because my bank account is paperless I cannot do a screenshot on a paperless account,2025-02-11,4

"Well, first, you have to subscribe, and that costs $5.99, so if your flat-out broke, this app won't help you. Second, they charge you fees on top of the subscriptions to get the money instantly.

The loans are reasonable but after you've been using it for a while it starts acting funny like won't let pay my subscription which is 14.99 a month but it allowed me to repay my loan but can't get anything else payments have been made on time and this happens,2025-01-03,4
This app is not what they say for while it was cool then I payed attention to thy where making double pay my subscription then not allowing me to get my other have my advance til the first advance was paid or you pay your subscription and still nothing now I'm canceling my whole subscription because they're say I didn't pay it even when I'm showing.

So the app was great and it truly helped me out when I was in a jam but I just want people to know I subscribed to a 3 month agreement and they gave me a 30$ bost for any future advances but they also told me to apply for their card and I did and when I was going through the steps they offered a promotion which I needed to complete some task in 30days and I would get even more advances in the future. The app logged me out and it doesn't exist. Customer service basically said nothing we can do.,2025-01-01,4
I'm the beginning it was cute how Cleo is all up in your business but the categories of things like shopping eating out etc doesn't itemize correctly. All they see is money in money out l.,2024-12-31,4

I just hate when apps lie to the people to make money like they say theyll give you a advance but soon as you try to get one you end up paying money to them lol like im looking for money not looking to pay you money its obvious im ouy of a job like what makes you think ill need it when i get a job i dont understand these apps.,2024-12-28,4
"The app promises you can get an advance up to $500, but you have to pay up front for the subscription and that is the only way to get an advance. If one reads the fine print, the advance promised can range from $2- $250, so long as you dont have any outstanding advanced. That is why you have to pay up front for the dubscription, because after you pay the $14.99 your advance may only be $5, so youd actually lose $10 first month and be stuck owing every month after. No thanks, ill wait til payday",2024-12-27,4
Notification to pay early lies to pay early,2024-12-26,4
"I installed the app, never requested any money but you have charged 5.99 twice. I wrote to you when the first 5.99 was debited, thought that would do it but in December you debited another 5.99.

The app sounds great. But was charge 2 times at initial sign up. Had to take a cash advance just for the overdraft fee that the 2nd charge caused. Tried to get help and was told it was escalated to a team to get this fixed and refunded and would have a response within 1-3 business days. Great! Over a week later and still haven't heard anything. I haven't even had this service for half a month and was charged for the subscription AGAIN!!! STILL CANT GET HELP!,2024-12-17,4

"Update: Not so great. Initially I qualified for $100 and then 2 weeks later for $250. I've been eligible to borrow $250 each time for the past several months-I ALWAYS repay on time or early, no change to my income & all of a sudden I went from qualifying for $250 every 2 weeks down to $140 and now 2 weeks later I only qualify for $115. I signed up for the builder card and that's when my eligible amount went down. Cancelled the builder card and now am only eligible for a $75 advance. Not awesome.",2024-12-06,4
Not so good they offer the less bit on advance,2024-12-05,4
Unknown fees,2024-12-04,4
Your advertisement online seems deceptive. The black guy says you can borrow 80 and that's all you pay back and we all know that's not true nothing's for free. You also say that you get the advance immediately and that's not the case I had to wait a day for it if I'm taking out an advantage it's because I need it right there and then so that was disappointing.,2024-12-03,4

I linked a different account and the numbers were still off.",2024-11-28,4
You pay 6 bucks a month to borrow 45 at a time but it cost u bucks to use the 45. They give you 90 but make you split it up. Making the fees horrible. But if your in a bind I guess it helps..,2024-11-28,4
I cannot find where to login on at anywhere.,2024-11-27,4
I make 1600 a week and it gave me 50 dollars to start which is nothing actually technically it was 7 dollar charge so not even 50. Which again 50 dollars when you have to a premium membership fee plus The fee they charge for not waiting 3 to 4 business days it's actually a rip off.,2024-11-23,4
"It was great until today. The money for my payment was removed from my checking account, however Cleo is saying that I am overdue and it wasn't paid.

"Cleo is a fickle AI. Just when you become accustomed to getting a second cash advance, she cuts you off with no reason and no change to finances. Then it leaves you with that gap between payperiods that she used to help out with. Dont bother with customer service, its nonexistent. If u do by chance get a human, they claim to not be in control of Cleo, that she cannot be fixed on their end. Not cool, Cleo.",2024-11-16,4
"This app sucks sometimes. They don't let the other amount come to your bank account. It say's processing or something like that untill you have to pay it back. You only get one advance, I should say. It works when it wants, I should say that also.",2024-11-15,4
Still sucks,2024-11-15,4
I love Cleo she gives high advances I just don't like the fact that I missed one subscription payment and now it's been over a month and a half and she still won't let me barrow so for that your getting two stars,2024-11-14,4
I cant speak to anyone. I can't get an advance to my account it has to go on their card but I don't even have a physical card. Ridiculous,2024-11-13,4

Not really helpful. They decide how little you can borrow for 15 days..,2024-11-02,4
In my experience this app hasn't been helpful. I opened it awhile ago then closed it and reopened some time later using a different account. The advances (40$ btw) keep going to the old account I disconnected! Now payment is due when I never actually received the advance. Theirs no way to get actual assistance on this app from a human not a bot!,2024-10-31,4

I'm having the worst time ever with my advance been doing this since yesterday and chatting with a bot who is not helping me. I'm so sad and frustrated. I paid for plus got advance to borrow. I believe 35 dollars. my bank accounts are connected to cleo... then when it gets to step 3 it just sits there and does nothing. Bot keeps telling me to contact support which I thought I was and I can't get any real or live persons to help. Geez.,2024-10-23,4

"It's ok. Although, it doesnt charge anything other than what you borrow...which is nice! It also doesnt offer much TO borrow either.",2024-10-18,4
The app is like a loop and takes you on a desperate ride to looking for answers which are not at all forthcoming in the chat option. I'm mad beyond description as my credit builder card hasn't arrived in the mail for almost a month now and I can't seem to talk to customer care which made my experience even worse. They really need to work on this.,2024-10-17,4
I haven't been able to borrow anything even though it says that I am eligible. Says that I can get my credit score for no charge. I have tried to get my credit score twice and both times I have been unable to get it. The app just wants me to. Upgrade to the paid version. 2 stars was probably 2 stars too many,2024-10-16,4
The app is very easy to access. But you can get a loan pay it back early or put back on time and you're still going to get the same amount as last time or maybe even lower. And on top of that it only uses one of my accounts when I can't understand why they don't use Cashspps account because that's where a lot of my money comes from so they got stuff a little backwards,2024-10-12,4
Advance are not enough get bigger Advance other places once get chance leaving,2024-10-10,4
To be honest it's OK for a quick few bucks in a hurry but the amounts you can borrow always change and they never go up they always go down they want you to subscribe to get more or invite friends but they charge a fee for borrowing anyways so why have a different subscription when you already pay for one the highest I was able to borrow was 90 now it's down to 75 even though I pay it back on time most times even early makes no sense,2024-10-10,4
Have to pay fee before you can see the advance amount. And the fee to advance ratio is nearly twice as much as other options. Waste of 5.99,2024-10-10,4
Frustrating,2024-10-09,4
"I have had Cleo several months. I have taken out a small amt on payday and repaid it and have never missed or been late. Two weeks ago, after repaying, it told me I was ineligible for a new one.

My payday and salary haven't changed, my spending habits haven't changed yet I can't take money out and no one can tell me why!!",2024-09-30,4
"Review may be subject to change depending on response, but right now I can't do much with the app as it shows my bank acct ( US Bank) as refreshed, but won't allow me to select it for anything or even as default.

the monthly fee isn't bad for a pay day loan. But the app is old school chat not. Not AI. It roasted me for spending so much on my utilities. Like. What? Won't attach to cash app. And the referral rewards that say you can EARN BIG and get paid out ON TOP of the cash advance? LIES. it's literally just letting you get a bigger advance.

I don't understand why do I have to pay a subscription of $5.99 per month. If I had it I would need to borrow money.

This app was amazing at first. An then I accidentally disputed an advance payback. Well I paid cleo back for that dispute an they now have closed my account an then reported on my credit report that I owe then money for a credit card?

I've used this app for over a year and now it's acting up. Shouldn't the eligibility check include everything including these state laws?

"Compared to similar cash advance apps, it rates low for me. Firstly, is the monthly fee of minimum $5.99 - maximum $15-16. Secondly, is the inability to see how much you are approved for to even determine if the app is worth the advance. I'm less likely to sign up if I don't know what I'm going to receive.

Every week amount of loans goes up and down even though I pay off my loan early every week,2024-11-02,4
"Its a good app to use but it's not the best one out there because it took so long to get it, the enrollment process was kinda complicated and it made my head hurt but after SEVERAL tries it finally worked",2024-10-29,4
"Trying to subscribe but keeps telling me to update app, and its up to date already",2024-10-28,4
"Helpful with questions, but not with advances. You still have to pay for a ""subscription"" before you can get an advance.",2024-10-23,4
Can use some improvement,2024-10-22,4
Love the bots chats,2024-10-21,4
This app is kinda pushy. It's always showing you choices of where to get a personal loan or efficient ways to budget your money. It also does not allow to make partial payments on the advance.,2024-10-20,4
"I pay my monthly fee but still have gotten no cash advance, very bummed",2024-10-19,4
"Whatever just happens with that update, needs to be reevaluated. Now I can't even get the app to go past September transactions. If it wasn't for that I'd rate 4",2024-10-17,4
Customer service is the worst I have ever dealt with I don't like the bit doesn't work on on and on no humans ever,2024-10-13,4
I had to unsubscribe. Been using it for 6 months and the advances will go up at first and then it started going lower and lower. I used to get $250 and after paying my $100 it went down to $90. I was happy it helping but not like that.,2024-10-07,4
I love the fact that you can talk to the app it's actually fun.,2024-10-03,4
Has really helped me in a bind.also seeing the spending that I didn't need to spend was an eye opener. But the fact that if you pay on time and pay off early doesn't help you get a bigger advance you never can make it to the 250 or high advance that's fir sure plus keeps deleting my cards I have saved for prepayment draft .,2024-09-26,4
It's ok but I pay back before the date or on the date then my advance amount drops that's crazy,2024-09-26,4
NEEDS BETTER CUSTOMER SERVICE... YOU HAVE TO WAIT SEVERAL HOURS TO GET HELP OR A REPLY FROM A ACTUAL HUMAN,2024-09-26,4
"I am modifying my original review (8/18/24), as Cleo did finally help me out. They can now update your renewal card and activate it for you without system delay. I just wish it was easier to increase your borrow amount. It takes too long and the borrow amount is too low. I make over 5k/monthly, and Cleo let's me borrow $60 bi-weekly...it simply doesn't match? I wish they would fix their algorithms, as they are very off.",2024-09-20,4
"Every time I'm in a bind & think I have no way to make it to my paycheck Cleo comes through. However, the subscription fee on top of the repayment fee for instant funding is high. Losing $10+ seems to be the average for all of these apps. Every dollar counts these days & I just wish corporations would consider this for consumers instead of their bottom line.",2024-09-20,4
Like the app just wish it would offer me more of an advance,2024-09-20,4
Always on the fence with how I feel about this app,2024-09-20,4
Ok,2024-09-19,4
Keeps saying something went wrong won't let me get advance,2024-09-16,4
always something that keeps me from,2024-09-11,4
Not really sure what I think about this about atm,2024-09-06,4
Everytime I try to login with my bank it keeps going back to the login page,2024-09-05,4
Amazing app for what is needed,2024-09-05,4
Started using about 2 months ago and really liked this app. Then somehow my pay back dated was changed to a date right before pay day. I wasn't able to pay back til the next day. So now they won't give me what I usually get because of something they did,2024-09-04,4
I've used Cleo before and stopped. It would only let me get $20 and I also have to pay 5.99 a month. Got in a real bind. Decided to go back to it and it said I was approved for $60. But I tried to change my card and it wouldn't let me so my only option was to get it send to my account which would take 3-5 days. I'll have my paycheck by then. Charged me the $5.99 wouldn't let me change my card and while I was trying to change my card it went down to $20 offer. Now I see why I left Cleo alone,2024-09-03,4
They will help but after the first advance they drop it to 30.,2024-08-29,4
"Cleo has been having issues updating and refreshing the current bank account status. Every week, cleo never has my correct bank account balance.",2024-08-23,4
It updated the T&Cs and it won't let me access the app. There is no option to read the Terms and Conditions. I have Uninstalled multiple times and keeps giving me the same message,2024-08-22,4
"I've downloaded the app, but after I read a lot of reviews I decided to not use Cleo & delete the app.",2024-08-17,4
"The app was fine but now it seems to not update accurately. I went from having a higher borrow to the lowest because it keeps saying I'm paying a day late. Also, I've payed and it still hasn't updated so my account is saying I'm 2 days behind when in reality, its on time. 🙃 I've uninstalled and reinstalled. So now my limit is $40.",2024-08-17,4
"I erased my original review. All I'll say is I'm starting to see small improvements, but a long way to go especially with the AI",2024-08-16,4
"The app is ok, fees are kinda high and annoying but it can help on the short term.",2024-08-16,4
cleo is awesome,2024-08-16,4
Don't really like this app hurts more than helps maybe it's mr idk,2024-08-16,4
"I like the app, but it never increases the amount you can borrow even if you consistently pay it back on time and pay for the subscription. In order to receive over $250, you have sign up for direct deposit. I've been using the app for a year now, and it's the same old same. I can't rate it any higher because other apps I've used have been more useful with borrowing, increases in amount, and no subscription charges.",2024-08-16,4
Love the budget tools.,2024-08-16,4
The app is glitchy.,2024-08-16,4
"I like the concept of the app, though it would be a really good app if there was real AI in it. Yes chatbots are technically AI but like real chatgpt like AI would make this app memorable and more intriguing to listen to. I enjoy the concept of it roasting but it ends as soon as you type your own message out removing the immersion. AI would make this app that little bit better.",2024-08-15,4
Found this app on Google. It's promoted as a free cash advance service. It is not. Monthly membership fee for the cash advance plus another fee to get the advance almost immediately. But when you need emergency help there aren't many choices. Funds were transferred quickly which is nice.,2024-08-15,4
I just wanna get a advance for the next few days to be in a room,2024-08-08,4
It's ok but when I want to deactivate your account it's damn near impossible 😤😡,2024-08-05,4
"I APPRECIATE THE LOAN, BUT I DON'T APPRECIATE BEING LIED TO. TELLS ME THEY WILL LOAN ME $250. THEN $100 CAME DOWN TO $40. I WANTED $ 100 LIKE ALL INTERNET COMPANY'S THEY TELL YOU ONE THING THEN CHANGE IT AROUND. I'M REALLY TIRED OF NOT HAVING A PH # PROVIDED TO TALK TO REAL PERSON.",2024-08-04,4

Just now deciding,2024-07-31,4
"I really needed an advance so I installed the app and filled the application, and then after I got to the getting the money sent to me, I already linked my bank account info,they tell me that I have to subscribe for $5.95, I don't have the subscription fee and that left me feeling like I just wasted my time,",2024-07-30,4
"The app says I have an advance available but when I get to the borrow tab, and click to confirm, it says ""something went wrong, please retry later"", no matter which distribution method I select. It's been doing this since Friday.",2024-07-29,4
Gave me one advance once. And never got offered an advance from Cleo again.,2024-07-27,4
"I have been with this app for quite a long time now. I'm never late on payments, but my advance is always 100 nothing close to 250. Hopefully I get there soon",2024-07-25,4
You can't pay the membership fee manually that makes no sense,2024-07-24,4
"I used to enjoy this app, but the newest update that dropped today made the app completely unusable. I really hope they fix it because it isn't loading any info, and the load times for everything are extremely long. Overall, the app currently seems broken. I've tried re-downloading it 3 times as well as restarting my phone 🤷‍♀️",2024-07-20,4
Very bad experience. App lag's too long and always forces you to resign up. This causes you to start all over again.,2024-07-19,4
I like Leo's commentaries but I feel I should be able to advance more money and pay back in payments it's my money I'm borrowing,2024-07-18,4
Great,2024-07-17,4
I don't know they didn't give me anything but I do know they charge me a fee.,2024-07-16,4

The app was doing good I was able and been getting approved for $40.. and I have the credit builder card as well I took another advance for $40 instead this time it said it was take 24 hours and it's been three days ...

It won't let me get past trying to verify my phone number. It sends me a code but doesn't let me key it in anywhere.,2024-07-05,4
Frustrating,2024-07-03,4
Shouldn't have to pay or should let u use ur advance,2024-06-28,4
They want you to pay the monthly fee upfront before you know what your advance is. Depending on what they give you. It could be a waste of time and first month's fee.,2024-06-22,4
I don't like how if you want to borrow money.It only leaves you at 40 if you don't have direct deposit.I believe if you pay your bill when it's supposed to be paid.Other limits to what you can borrow should be at your disposal,2024-06-21,4
If I need to borrow money why would I have money to pay you a subscription fee first. Makes no sense as to why you can't take these subscription fee out of the cash advance.,2024-06-21,4
"I used to be able to get it sent straight to my card attached to my bank, but now, since I got the cleo card, I no longer have that option.

So far so good I have to use this app for awhile longer to get more of a opinion,2024-06-15,4
In the beginning it was good. Now it seems like a bunch of BS. I'm going to give it one more month and if still the same BS in cancelling my subscription.,2024-06-12,4
"I will give them 3 stars because they roasted me while charging me $8 for a $60 loan and requiring me to pay it back in 8 days when I only get paid once a month on Social Security. I haven't actually been using this app very long, so I'll update in the future.",2024-06-07,4
"I like the service, but I hate the app. It freezes constantly and takes forever to accomplish anything. It took me several attempts to update my card info. I kept having to close and reopen the app and start over. I tried 2 different devices, and had the same results. So it's an app problem, not a problem with my phone.

"They reduced my approved amount, in spite of my paychecks being direct deposited and the advances paid in full on time. They carelessly begin trying to debit the advance prior to the posting of the paycheck. I'm sorry but if it were possible to pay back the advance prior to the paycheck posting I wouldn't have needed the advance. I had the plan of 4weeks to get myself out of the hole i was in. They reduced my amount too soon! I highly recommend the Klover app to all in need.",2024-05-14,4

"When I first got this app it allowed me to borrow I paid back and now I can't borrow but whatever reason I get over $1,200 in my account a month even if I overdrafted my account in my regular account is in the negative I always pay back I've had my bank account since 2016 but for some reason that's not enough for Cleo",2024-04-07,4

"3/19/2024 Edit: I have edited my original disparaging comment and raised my review from 1 to 3 stars, as well as obviously removed my complaint on the original review. Reason being: Cleo's team recently reached out to me for a call/interview to gain insight as to why I stopped their direct deposits. This shows initiative to identify possible issues and an interest in their consumers satisfaction with the app, so for that, I will give Cleo a raise. Thanks for the time, much appreciated.",2024-03-19,4

This app not only keeps me on track but hilariously roasts me when I'm messing up. I like it. However the app updated and now is a brown color. I already see enough brown at my other job and I don't like the color scheme. Its ugly and pisses me off. dropped a star just for that.,2025-06-05,4
I love it,2025-06-04,4
fees are a little high but overall I like this app when it says you get the money instantly it's there within seconds so I am satisfied with that,2025-06-03,4

thank you for my money,2025-05-09,4
cleo is amazing it help me set spending limits and goals to help my family,2025-05-08,4
it's great but only borrow if it is an absolute must,2025-05-03,4
I am hoping that this app will help raise my credit score.,2025-04-30,4
so far so good. everything is going good,2025-04-30,4
"ZERO, help .... cannot get a human service representative. The online phone number is blocked. I have $$$ on their Visa card that cannot be used. Cannot contact a person to help and the A.I is no help. if I could give less than zero I would. But they will definitely send you messages about when to pay.. that part works. WORTHLESS",2025-04-29,4
"So far, so good! I got an $80 cash advance to get me through in between paychecks. It also helps boost my credit!",2025-04-28,4
easy set up,2025-04-28,4
Does pay out. Be sure to read about all fees from subscription to payout through repayment.,2025-04-27,4
I just hope I can get that far someday!,2025-04-27,4
tandilizing,2025-04-25,4
I love Cleo but today is giving me a pay back date of 2 weeks ago even though I'm already paid off and qualify for more. I also don't have the option to get help,2025-04-25,4
so far so good,2025-04-24,4
good no let me rephrase it Chloe is better than good,2025-04-23,4
"so far, I am liking it, she's better than other automated responses, she understand what I'm saying, n never yet have I gotten an "" sorry I don't understand"" so far so good, if it continues I'll be back to up it to 5 star.",2025-04-23,4
the automated system only recognized certain things need a live agent to talk to,2025-04-22,4
excellent,2025-04-21,4
Will find out. first time user.,2025-04-20,4
decent,2025-04-20,4
"very good app, for everyone!",2025-04-20,4
if I was cleo on set it off I see how I'm rob 💯,2025-04-19,4
very great,2025-04-19,4
so far Cleo has been one the many lenders that has been honest with me.,2025-04-18,4
I love how it roast me I wish I could add my cash app lol,2025-04-16,4
"ok, these ppl are great",2025-04-15,4
"pretty good, i had a couple issues at first and they arnt quick but they do actually help if u talk to the humans. their bot is pretty much the same as all the others except in some cases u have to pick from multiple choice and cant actually say anything.... its aggrovating but once u get it rite they do come in real handy when u need it..",2025-04-14,4
the chat bot is kinda funny ngl and I was able to start out with a small amount then work my way up,2025-04-14,4
Just opened my subscription up yesterday on Cleo and it's working out great for me . Cleo has helpful tips and advice to get your financial situation better and your credit score improving as well.,2025-04-14,4
awesome,2025-04-12,4
Not the most straightforward app. You have to look around a bit to find things that don't stand out. Whole system is a bit janky now and then. Overall not bad though.,2025-04-11,4
good experience,2025-04-07,4
"It's been a good app for me. there's been plenty of ups and downs, but they do offer me a borrow amount.",2025-04-04,4
really does help u and make u think about the spending u don't need to be doing and how and what u need to help ur credit score or plain just increase ur credit checking and savings,2025-04-02,4
good,2025-04-01,4
good app to barrow money,2025-03-31,4
love the app the advances are a complete save,2025-03-28,4
Is application is very helpful. It tracks where you spend your money it figures out different ways to try to help you save money. It also lends you money. All together I think this is very good app.,2025-03-27,4
need to order a new credit card,2025-03-25,4
"Cleo has been great so far, until I updated it today and it logged me out,. after I re logged in and got to the actual app, it signed me out instantly is this a buggy update? I do have money on a credit builder card that I'm trying to access . please fix asap and I'll give the full 5 star rating back.",2025-03-25,4
easy to use and very convenient for just being on top of your spending 💰,2025-03-24,4
love Cleo! so different than anything else out there! it's awesome!,2025-03-23,4
"This app has gotten better over time and comes in clutch when I need advance. The price is a bit steep for same-day advance but as far as fees are concerned it's definitely not the worst I've come across. If you don't mind the extra $35 a month (includes $14.99 monthly and $8.99 instant fee per advance), it's worth the access to the services provided. There are features I do not use that would be available to someone with direct deposit that would justify the fees imo",2025-03-22,4
I'm surprised that there is no customer service to talk to an actual life person,2025-03-18,4
Easy to use,2025-03-16,4
Always comes through when I'm in a clutch,2025-03-15,4
so far so good,2025-03-14,4
I'm can't get it to work for me,2025-03-14,4
I like it some of the fees are a bit high but if you need a bit of cash it's helpful,2025-03-14,4
I always pay it back but sometimes my auto repay hits before my check and it hurts me. That's my biggest complaint.,2025-03-14,4
Always there when I need extra cash. Cleo helps whenever I need it.,2025-03-13,4
"Since I'm already paying for an account, I feel it is overdoing it by charging to get money from borrow as well. Should make it cheaper or free",2025-03-12,4
Very convenient,2025-03-12,4
Cleo is helps fr,2025-03-11,4
Very personal,2025-03-08,4
Helpful,2025-03-07,4
If my advances would stay the same I'd give 5 stars,2025-03-07,4
I just love it,2025-03-01,4
Pretty good for a cash advance app but also for money management. The AI assistant really is helpful sometimes. I wish I had enough self control to actual listen to her...,2025-02-23,4
Sweet app and it can cash advance you,2025-02-21,4
Great,2025-02-20,4
So far I really like this app,2025-02-20,4
"The app keeps freezing after I enter the code from my bank. It says that I have connected, and when I press ""continue"" it just shows a blank white page.",2025-02-18,4

Good,2025-02-11,4
Money app $$$ thx,2025-02-11,4
Very easy to deal with. Been usin this for about a year and no snags,2025-02-11,4
Easy app,2025-02-09,4
Awesome thanks,2025-02-09,4
"After using Cleo for a little while, I can say it is an easy app to use, and getting approved for at least $100 is very attainable. I would recommend Cleo.",2025-02-08,4
A little better,2025-02-08,4
Helps with my spending and can't beat the cash advance,2025-02-08,4
Definitely comes in handy but instant cash advances fluctuate which sucks at times besides that it's a good app,2025-02-07,4
Good credit builder,2025-02-06,4
Cleo is cool. It definitely comes in handy in those times....,2025-02-05,4
Nice,2025-01-30,4
Put me threw to get a loan,2025-01-29,4
Very worth it,2025-01-29,4
Very helpful and reliable along with accommodable,2025-01-28,4
Good app if you are in a pinch. Takes 20 minutes and then u receive your advance.,2025-01-25,4
Good,2025-01-24,4
"issue resolved ......... loyalty earned, i'd get it for everyone, in case anyone needs to borrow a few dollars",2025-01-23,4
So far this app has been reliable and easy to navigate. No issues for this customer. :),2025-01-22,4

"I haven't signed up for a paid membership because we (my wife and I) are looking for a joint account where we can both log in and get anything added. You do that, and we we will sign up AND do a period subscription.",2025-01-13,4
out of most other similar apps I've tried. I'd say Cleo is one I trust most to supply and help me with what I need and need to understand financially. Some improvements could be; give more options and informations on how to successfully move towards and fulfill investment goals that are set.,2025-01-11,4
BEST cash advance app that I've tried. They're reliable and allow you PLENTY of time to repay.,2024-12-30,4
This wasn't what I expected.,2024-12-28,4
Does what it says and it is kind of expensive though with the subscription. And the advanced fee to get your money right aways like six or seven bucks which is kind of spendy when your broke,2024-12-27,4
Personally I think that Cleo is one of the best platforms for my finances and gives excellent advice. I would recommend Cleo for anyone who needs financial guidance,2024-12-26,4
Funny app,2024-12-26,4
Still learning about the app but so far it's good as can be,2024-12-25,4
Great a8,2024-12-24,4
Too expensive,2024-12-23,4
"The loans are minimal, but they do what they are meant for. I appreciate the assistance, more than you know.",2024-12-23,4
Blessed,2024-12-22,4
So far it's been a good experience,2024-12-22,4
It hits close to home,2024-12-22,4
Cleo helps me when I need the help. Keeps track of what you spend also. I recommend her to anyone.,2024-12-21,4
Easy to use and understand.,2024-12-21,4
Pretty good tool for keeping eye on spending habits,2024-12-21,4
The app seemed invasive at first. But it uses your banking info to point out spending habits that I can turn into saving habits.,2024-12-21,4
Has helped me a lot 🤠,2024-12-21,4
"It works, it offers. It's really low, but fun to notice your spending. It only offers less than $100/Month, when you bring in around $2,000.",2024-12-21,4
GREAT APP! ALWAYS HAS MY BACK WHEN I DON'T EXPECT IT. THANK Y'ALL @ CLEO APP!..,2024-12-21,4
Great program 👍,2024-12-21,4
It's not bad just a lot different than other programs.,2024-12-21,4
Good but could up the advance,2024-12-21,4
"I pretty much never have issues when I need it. However I do think the support could be better, it's a bit hard to reach it in the rare cases I do have an issue. I get spammed with giveaways and the links never really lead me to the giveaway. Not really sure what's going there but ya it's mostly great",2024-12-21,4
When I was down Cleo stepped up..... roast me part of the app is great way to understand your spending,2024-12-21,4
So far I like this app,2024-12-21,4
💖💖,2024-12-21,4
Im happy so far,2024-12-20,4
Great app! It helps me a lot!,2024-12-20,4
Cleo is pretty decent,2024-12-20,4
Getting approved takes no time. Especially when you are in a crunch and need some money fast.,2024-12-20,4
Always good with Cleo. Helps me understand my spending habits.,2024-12-20,4
Very helpful trying to keep me on track,2024-12-20,4
"There great to have if you need gas money or anything but if you need bill money you gotta get it from somewhere else, I don't like the the monthly fee because I don't use them every month",2024-12-20,4
The roasting in chat is hilarious.,2024-12-20,4
Love how cleo keeps me ground and on track,2024-12-20,4
So far so good. Great app. The advances don't climb very quickly; if at all. I have yet to see. Update: The advance can be expensive. Not very high limits. Not to make it worth it for the membership fee and instant fees. It does give you a great breakdown of your budget.,2024-12-20,4
Quick and easy and it don't sugar coat nothing,2024-12-20,4
Okay the Roast Me part was pretty funny,2024-12-20,4
"Usually give me a great advance, but there are times you gotta work for it or take whatever you can get",2024-12-20,4
It's a very cool and interesting app,2024-12-18,4
Awesome,2024-12-17,4
Great app. Just wish I could have more than 1 main income stream,2024-12-15,4
Great app but it won't let me update my card keeps giving me an error,2024-12-14,4
Can't lie I've been loving Cleo here lately took a lil break & unsubscribed The only negative is a few bugs mainly in the borrow tab not acknowledging my bank account as linked which hindered me from receiving an advance yet that same account was used for repayment & my subscription I've had to message support a few times to fix it But once it was I was able to receive a Reload on my advance to receive another before my due date which came at the PERFECT TIME so A+ for that!,2024-12-13,4
"I must say, out of all of the cash advance apps, Cleo has been the best, most reliable option. They're fair about the payback time, giving you ample time to make sure that you have the funds available to repay. Their offers are decent. In my case, it's nothing much, but it has saved my butt a few times, and I'm very grateful for it. Other apps like Dave used to be great, but they're cheap and try to trick you into giving a tip. Smh. CLEO IS MY FAVORITE!",2024-12-12,4
So I get a loan if I pay for the Clio Plus so if I pay the 5.99 for subscription I can get it,2024-12-12,4
"Got a small loan easily. Only 1 week pay back option though... Nothing else. Still, I needed it and I got it easily.",2024-12-12,4
Great in a pinch..reasonable and easy. GREAT service..super fast! Love Cleo!!,2024-12-11,4
Great let's get money when I need it most,2024-12-10,4
I've used this app before and it was great! But now I can't even link my bank account and it's annoying. I liked using it because it was helpful. Now I can't even get it connected. Bummer.,2024-12-09,4
"The app has it's moments, but until Cleotilde thought I was being racist against one of her reps, which I clearly wasn't, and unsubscribed me, I was grateful for the money Cleo lent me--truly! There has been suspicious activity on my account, and the vibe has been off for weeks, and no one will do anything about it. I am truly frustrated! No one will talk to me about it.",2024-12-08,4
Very good app,2024-12-07,4
"I love me some Cleo! How she can tell you how much money you have spent on ""unnecessary "" things.. the only thing i don't like is the monthly subscription payment. I would love to get the Credit Builder card but 14.99 a month.. nah",2024-12-05,4
My rating not based on program itself my situation warranted to suspend my account till I am able to repay agent inability to suspend account is my fault not reading eula in detail other wise a 5 star rating deserved so issues with program but all in detail slowed my phone down while running ap stole the memory events lagging my phone,2024-12-05,4
"Love it Cleo comes thru in a pinch. However, having an issue this time. Page says need to update to get cash advance, I did that, yet was sent back to ""need to update page"", and it keeps on looping like that,(2nd day trying)",2024-12-04,4
I borrowed payback on time I prefer full borrow not installments,2024-11-29,4
Helps out tremendously,2024-11-28,4
Good so far,2024-11-27,4
Cleo is one of the best apps that I've ever downloaded.Their a wonderful team heck I look at them as kinda like family they have your best interest at heart .So if you haven't joined aclepnwhat are you waiting for you don't know what your missing out on as o download now you want regret it !!! I know I don't !!!,2024-11-27,4
An exception app fast at responding with AI and human personalities if your work it it works for you 🙏🙏💪💪,2024-11-26,4
"Great app. They give you room to borrow more money. It's a lil expensive for subscription, but that's all.",2024-11-26,4
Pretty good app,2024-11-25,4
"Overall a very good experience and as always, Cleo has my back when needed most. Thank you, Cleo. You're a Godsend.",2024-11-23,4
App is not refreshing or taking my payment,2024-11-22,4
So far so good,2024-11-21,4
Good,2024-11-21,4
Super helpful and convenient app when qualified and accepted for an account. Having the opportunity for an advance when the usual outcome for someone is always limited to none is also relieving.,2024-11-20,4
Its been helpful.,2024-11-18,4
Good app but then started telling me I got 2 accounts and won't let me do anything now. Trying to sort it out with customer service but taking a while to get done. Will rate better once all is corrected and I'm able to resume normal app functions.,2024-11-16,4
Not bad for a quick option.,2024-11-16,4
I love Cleo but there is no way to get a human easy and they locked my card so it's like I'm just screwed but I do enjoy the app it's a lot of help!,2024-11-16,4
Was able to get a $40 with no credit check. Just make sure your on time with your payments,2024-11-16,4
"I like the options it gives me, the only thing is that the app knows when I get paid, it send me a notification. I assumed my loan was auto paid, but it wasn't and I didn't get notification of it not being paid until I was broke. Go figure. Now that I know it won't happen again.",2024-11-16,4
"It's okay, don't like having to pay a fee to use it though. If I had money I wouldn't need the app.",2024-11-16,4
Love it,2024-11-16,4
So far it's good,2024-11-15,4
Great app easy to use,2024-11-15,4

Easy to navigate and get advances,2024-11-15,4
A good app to get a cash advance from . You can get another advance as soon as you pay off the advance you took .,2024-11-15,4
Is a good option for short money issues.,2024-11-15,4
It's fees are the only negative I have for them,2024-11-15,4
Helps a lot,2024-11-15,4
"I believe the app could be more detail oriented when advertising cash advances to lure people in. Other than that, the app is super fun and modern.",2024-11-15,4
The way the app interacts with me is almost like its not just an app but a friend to me i enjoy the informational games we play and all the fun ways that it helps me save.,2024-11-15,4
awesome,2024-11-15,4

Decent app. I need to take it more seriously but it's good,2024-11-15,4

Very simple. Thank you,2024-11-15,4
Cleo is smart and bright and brings wonderful toys and goodies to all the boys and girls,2024-11-15,4
Consulted at times but you do get cash advances for a monthly fee whether you use the service or not.,2024-11-15,4
Awesome. Helped me in several ways,2024-11-15,4
"It's low, but it works. Funny little app.",2024-11-15,4
Great for advances but won't give me over 40 without paying an arm and leg and even when I did pay i wasn't approved over 40,2024-11-15,4

Cleo is here when I need them,2024-11-15,4
"Always a good experience, haven't had any issues!",2024-11-15,4
Good app but I don't know why I get such a low advance knowing I only get one check a month and it's the same time every month,2024-11-15,4
Overall it's good but sometimes the AI chat can be annoying.,2024-11-15,4
Works as stated. Overall pretty satisfied with what they offer. If needed I'd recommend,2024-11-15,4
Great when your in a bind !,2024-11-15,4
I don't like the membership fee but otherwise it's a good app,2024-11-15,4
Not bad to get a little bit of help,2024-11-15,4
Amazing app that helps when you need it,2024-11-15,4
Very helpful in tight situations,2024-11-15,4
I wish it would go up instead of down when I pay back the loan but I like the app pretty well. I wish it wasn't so much to get it immediately but all in all 4 stars,2024-11-15,4
Need more advance,2024-11-15,4
It works as long as you have regular income,2024-11-15,4

Great,2024-11-15,4

"In today's climate, I must say that I respect and am impressed by the direction they took this app. It's absolutely hysterical, intuitive af and has great timing which is key for me. It's engaging and fun while still delivering the goods in terms of it's point, helpfulness. I haven't experienced this much fun while effing banking iml! Cons: The UI is confusing at times, prices a bit steep, and cash app can instantly transfer, this coming? I truly like this, ur almost there guys, almost!",2024-11-15,4
"Good app, helped me in a pinch.",2024-11-15,4
Has helped increase my credit score and the payment advance is always helpful,2024-11-15,4
"The app is great for mot only tracking spending but observing your trends and seeing where you sound the most. They also provide cash advances. The only issue is that even after many updates, the app lags sooooo much that it makes it difficult to use. I still use the the app for cash advances and to track spending and don't plan on deleting it.",2024-11-15,4

"The amount of cash advance has dropped lower and when I need an advance I would prefer a higher amount. $40.00 doesn't buy much these days. That doesn't even fill up the gas tank or get much in groceries, if needed. My previous advances have always been paid back and because I get paid only once a month, I often need to extend the repayment time. I don't understand why I get such a short time to pay back when you can see my accounts and you can see that the pay is only once a month.",2024-11-06,4
