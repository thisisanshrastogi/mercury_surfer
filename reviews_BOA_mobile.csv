This app's user interface is incredibly frustrating. Simple tasks require far too many taps and feel unnecessarily cumbersome. The amount of friction in navigating and completing basic actions (especially paying a credit card) is surprising for an app from such a large bank. It honestly feels like it was designed by a team with limited experience in UX/UI principles. I hate when I have to use it.,2025-05-03,1
"Recently they changed the mobile alerts for charges made online. Before it would show you the dollar amount, so if you remember your charges you could see it and know where it came from, or if you saw an amount you don't recognize, you could then go into the app and look where that charge came from. Now it just says ""debit card has been used online, check for details"" so now EVERY SINGLE charge has to be checked to keep in top of any potential fraud. It's incredibly frustrating.",2025-05-21,1
"The app is ok, but it could use a few improvements. I like to manage my net worth on the app as well, and the app doesn't calculate it correctly. It double counts one of my internal accounts. It adds the same account as external accounts. It's been over two years, and no one can seem to fix this problem. I heave reported it several times.",2025-05-03,1
"'WHEN' it ACTUALLY WORKS, it's Great. BUT it ALWAYS Tells ME that i am 'not connected to the Internet' (to use it) AFTER I've logged on already & having to wait several minutes at a time just to be able to GET to the FIRST 'ACCOUNTS' screen. Then, a never-ending 'BofA isn't Responding' Caption follows & I just LEAVE bcuz i CAN'T SEE trying to continue using it. At this point, it's only serving to take up data & save information from my device; I'm gonna 'uninstall' and do business elsewhere.",2025-05-19,1
"Generally, I agree with most reviewers who complain about this app's performance: slow, non-intuitive, difficult to navigate. For me, the most frustrating issue is trying to deposit checks via this App! I admit that I have shaky hands but even after I take the photo myself the App suddenly says, ""Oops. Something has gone wrong. Try again later."" Every time. Useless!",2025-04-12,1
"I avoid using their card and app for 90% of my purchases because the app doesn’t offer an option to automatically pay the full statement balance, unlike Amex, Chase, or even basic credit unions. This design increases the risk of interest charges, especially when busy or distracted. It feels like a trap, and for that reason, I can’t rely on this card and app for everyday use or recommend it... no.",2025-05-10,1
"Needs a dark mode. Check deposit does not always work and is very finicky to use. ""Less light is needed"", ""More light is needed"", ""Move closer"", ""Move back"" over and over and never lets you deposit the damn check. Getting worse. ""Insights"" is just a platform for ads, now. When I sign in to do banking, I do NOT want to have to click through a goddamn ad first! This app is the definition of ""enshitification"", now.",2025-04-19,1
"this app SUCKS if you have multiple accounts!!!! I have 3 accounts, and when you try to log out of one and into another it kicks you out MULTIPLE times as you try to log in using your finger print. I have to physically enter my log in info manually to get into the next account. VERY ANNOYING when I'm trying to bounce between the 3 accounts. This has been a problem for over a year.....you would think they would fix this issue by now. Horrible app!",2025-03-22,1
"I have been using BOA billpay for over a decade. It used to be a reliable workhorse. Recently, BOA has become more aggressive at pushing their immature less than Beta quality agent. Erica is stupid and slows me down. BOA does not use AI to help me navigate its menus, which would be easy and low risk to implement. I spent three hours setting up ACH transfers because the prompts are counterintuitive.",2025-03-28,1
Terrible. I ordered the Alaska miles credit card and set up through B of A app I messed around with it for about 45 minutes and couldn't figure out how to even add my bank account to pay the credit card fee. I ended canceling the credit card shortly after because the app was too frustrating. Shame bc i would have liked to have that card. I'm in my 40s and moderately tech savvy and use 10ish online banking and finance apps. This is by far the worst. not intuitive nor user friendly,2025-04-18,1
"This app is very glitchy. When I try to change between accounts it logs you out. You log in again, click to switch accounts, logs you out. Do it 5 more times and finally you're in. Some days you could click it for an hour and it will log you out every time. Sometimes it works on the first try like it's an actual functioning app. But most days after about 3 attempts I walk away from banking today and try again tomorrow. If there were an alternative app, I would most definitely scratch this one!",2025-03-16,1
"this is the most complicated bank application I have ever used. any time task, like making a payment, setting up auto pay, adding a new bank account to pay you credit card with, EVERYTHING requires an extensive amount of time trying to figure out where and how to do it. careful, they won't let you pay your credit card with a new bank account until they send small deposits to your account to ""Verify"" which takes 3 days. this is to make you late on your payment, don't be fooled. worst bank",2025-05-14,1
"By far the WORST banking app I've used (out of the 9 I use on a regular basis). Set up paperless billing from the get-go, but then never received a statement, and couldn't set up a payment account via the mobile app (had to be in a web browser). Just discovered you can't even make a custom payment amount through the mobile app - only the statement balance or the minimum amount due. What a joke! Why even have a mobile app???",2025-05-14,1
"Since last update, the app does not perform well. It keeps crashing. It becam e very slow. It is now a year later since my review above. The slow condition has not changed. It might even be a somewhat slower. I use the app several times per day. It is imposible to make Zelle payments. It just keeps frozen after the option for Zelle is selected.",2025-03-22,1
I have no idea how this terrible app has 4 stars. Can't send yourself an email confirming a balance payment. The payment record doesn't show up for up to two days. So you can't tell if it's already paid or not. I frequently find myself overpaying because of this basic stuff that is just non-existent.,2025-04-04,1
"Horrible user interface, not easy to navigate through statements or set up auto pay to a credit card, whoever designed the app needs to fired. Update: nothing has changed, still the worst banking app in existence. tried to pay the bill and it defaulted back to the home screen. no confirmation, nothing. really horrible",2025-03-22,1
it's not just the app it's the bank itself too. regarding the app you can only view your FICO score but you cannot get anything else like reports about new accounts dark web searching if for seeing if your information or security was compromised. Don't be misled by their interest rate which is almost zero it's 0.01 which means 100th of 1% not 1%. they do have a good mobile check deposit option.,2025-05-01,1
"Seems after a recent update, the app now crashes and restarts going back to login when taking a photo of a check for a deposit. Does it consistently, have rebooted phone, app is updated. Have to resort to using the app on my *gasp* ipad to do the same. Otherwise, I have no problems with the app. Samsung Galaxy S24FE, TMobile, Android 14, OneUI 6.1. Otherwise I have no problem with the app, does what a banking app should do. Unfortunately I need it for depositing checks more than anything.",2025-03-20,1
I love the app prior to the changes both on website and here. it was much more user friendly. Now you have to use two screens and when you make a payment it never puts you back to the location you made payment from it puts you back to the top and then you have to scroll all the way back down to the bottom. it is not user friendly at all. It also makes it difficult to transfer from one Bank of America to My accounts at other Banks suck as saving and checking account.,2025-02-19,1
"I have never used such an awful mobile app for banking. You can't set up a custom value for monthly auto-pay (likely intentional), setting up credit payments is extremely odd and could only be done through the website page, and the general interface looks like it's been programmed by a government lackey. Feels like an app from 2012. Never banking with y'all after I pay off this promotional card. I may just pay it off tomorrow so I don't have to deal with the poorly designed user interface.",2025-02-06,1
"Is it me or does it seem odd when an app offers a feature but said features aren't working properly or have stopped working altogether. I'm referring to the My Balance and the App Deposit features. There was a time when I used both of these all the time but overtime, the My Balance feature no longer works for me and the App Deposit stops working after I snap a picture of the 2nd side. God forbid you try contacting support, you HAVE to go ERICA first, and she's limited at best. Oh well.",2025-01-24,1
"Is there a single UX designer who reviewed this app before it was released? My god there is so much JUNK. I simply want to see my credit balance, my transactions, and my rewards balance. I have to click through so many different menus and statements, etc. to just see my recent purchases. All while being distracted by whatever BS BoA is trying to push to get more money from us. This app needs to be streamlined, bigtime. It makes me want to cancel my card.",2025-01-23,1
What a disaster this app is. Information and actions scattered all over in unrelated groups of menus. Tons of junk items all over the screens. Cant tell where you are expected to click on as sometimes its the whole framed section and sometimes only on text that isnt highlighted. And 75% of time you try to change something and it wont change and just says it cant do that right now and to try again later. I've had to have reps by phone reset my account options because the app wont let me.,2025-02-12,1
After finally figuring out the 4 steps to go to in order to pay my credit cards they went & changed the app again. Now they're called transfers instead of payments & works exactly like a transfer. I can no longer put a NOTE for what I'm paying so can't keep track or organized. Have to go online to add transfer between accounts memo. The neat features it had to distinguish from the website are gone so no point in using it. This app has been destroyed over last 2 years so 10/10 I do NOT recommend.,2024-12-19,1
"The app is limited with the available settings. I tried to stop the monthly balance transfer offers by mail but there is no way to stop them (The paperless option is already enabled) and calling customer service is a joke (45 mins wait) and then when the rep finally answered , I noticed there was 1 to 2 seconds voice lag and she didn't quite understand the issue so had to transfer me to another department who automatically hang up on me... Terrible Service!",2025-01-08,1
"I hate this app. Signing up was difficult, none of my points for Alaska Airlines are showing up. It shouldn't take 2 months for points to show up when I can take a miles for opinions survey for American Airlines and they show up the next day. It should also show a 0 balance when I make a payment. I was billed twice this month because I thought it didn't go through when I looked at it the day after I paid it.",2025-01-29,1
"The most difficult app to use, it is extremely difficult to pay on an account. Currently stuck in an endless loop where it won't let me enter an amount, only gives you an option to ""select amount"", and returns to previous screen without allowing to input amount, onlyvan option to ""select amount"".",2024-12-13,1
"I don't know what you did to the app, but ordering checks is impossible. I'm tempted to bank elsewhere. This is a basic function that every banking app should have. Used to be a great app, but to remove a feature like that and make it impossible to order is the silliest thing I've ever heard of. Opening with a smaller bank come Monday. I literally don't have time for this.",2025-01-26,1
"Every time I make a payment with Zelle, it submits the request twice. I click the submit button once and get the message about having recently made a similar payment. The first time I thought nothing of it (I had made a similar payment a few weeks ago to the same recipient and thought that that's what it was referring to). Not so. My attempt to send only $1000 resulted in $2000 being sent. Just had the same thing almost happen again. Shoddy app.",2025-05-14,1
"It was a great app, easy to track all your spending, make last second payments, keep an eye on any suspicious activity. But the the latest update makes the app no longer compatible with my phone. It's really disapointing that I can no longer use mobile banking just because I have an older phone.",2025-02-23,1
"if you have multiple credit cards through them, the app will not allow you to make new payments, even if you already have your bank info stored. I called 4 times to fix this issue and wasted hours waiting on hold, only to eventually pay the entire balance of the card over the phone and throwing away the cards. Save yourself the trouble and go with any other credit card provider or bank altogether.",2025-03-21,1
"You have too many tabs that complicate making payments. You need to cut down on the steps and simplify paying bills, and credit cards. You should have one tab for payments, one tab for history, one tab for accounts, one tab for activity, tab for earned credits from credit cards. Also a tab to view a detailed spreadsheet showing every payment out, any credits to be redeemed, any incoming funds such as deposits, wire transfers, ect. People are using their cell phones more than their computers.",2025-01-27,1
"This used to be a really good app. After the last update when you open the app it says wifi not connected even if it is. After trying a second time it connects. Also check deposit is not working! It says it can't read the picture. Edit: They fixed the wifi connection issue. Still not able to deposit checks, that's why I'm not changing the one star review.",2024-02-28,1
"I have un-installed and installed, cleared cache....you name it. I have not been able to use the ""transfer"" action in this app for MONTHS. It says try again when the developer fixes this bug. Well, it was updated July 1, 2024.....and of course it still won't work ! Mobile check deposit is a headache....can't just capture it within the frame, there is always something wrong. I have text alerts on....they don't come through. I've been a customer for over a decade. This app....Fed up!",2024-07-11,1
"Worst app ever!! The interface is horrendous. I couldn't not link my new Alaska CC to my other bank. This was so complicated. Now I can't even see my miles rewards. This is the most user unfriendly App ever from the very beginning, everything is so backward and just a drag. I have the Chase app, so I can definitely tell the difference between a good app and BOA! I think BOA should look at Chase and learn from it. I cannot wait to close both accounts, BOA and Alaska just because of this app.",2024-07-13,1
"Check scanning does not work correctly on my galaxy fold 3. It seems to have trouble lining up the check for taking the picture. This phone has strange screen dimensions, and two screens, but it's a popular model that's been around a long time. The app should have been tested for it. Now I have to decide if I have to change phones or change banks.",2024-08-07,1
"I don't know what's happened to this app, but it went from being a very useful, almost necessity for me to have, to being an absolutely user-antagonistic nightmare. It doesn't save my login information, no matter how many times I select ""remember ID"", my auto fill service works with every other app in my library, but this one, and it is one of the slowest apps I've ever used. Now I just use the mobile site, which is also a steaming pile of uselessness. Thanks, BofA.",2024-11-03,1
"New layout is pretty bad, extra small letters that look confusing. Moreover, added a lot of unnecessary steps when paying credit card/transferring funds between accounts. Why the hell do I have to click ""different amount"" to put in the amount I'm paying out of 3 useless options? And why do I have to go through another step to confirm the amount? I'm not blind, I know the amount I put in!",2024-02-07,1
New version is awful & inconvenient. All of my alert settings are gone. The functionality your credit card bill - 90% of the reason I even use the app - is confusing! The set up makes it look like you're paying from your credit card rather than paying your balance. It doesn't show your minimum payment or due date when setting up the payment bc it's on a different page. Other banks' apps are so much better - more modern and seamless! 👎🏼,2024-06-05,1
"One step away from actually go to the bank. While you can check your balance and transfer, if you have to deposit a check, you have to close all other apps on your phone, even the alarms. With all the updates, you'd think they'd figure out how to have the app take a picture without red lining processing power on phones that are a year old. They refuse to fix problems with the app.",2024-01-15,1
"Used to be able to deposit checks rapidly and flawless. Now with the simpler and automated deposit photography it's slow and impossible. Disappointing Update. Auto photography improved initially. Now back to impossible. Same pixel phone. Same background. Same lighting. But now constantly scolded. Too much light. Use darker background. Move closer. Move further away. Hold steady. I just take photograph manually which works fine. So please remove whatever artificial ""intelligence"" was added",2024-06-01,1
Latest update makes navigation more difficult. I used to be able to access bill pay from the first screen now it is buried 3 layers deep and requires clicking a menu that pops up. Go back to the old interface. Will update my review if they fix this. Why not make it easier to use? I won't be using Bill payer through Bank of America until they change this. Other bank apps are far easier to use.,2024-01-10,1
"The BA app has bugs with the bill pay process be careful. As of 8/13/2024, when you set up a payment on the app you won't see it on the browser. I freaked out and added a payment on the browser because it didnt show on the list. Then both payments go through so you will end up double paying and it still won't show up on your list even after payment just a debit on your checking account.",2024-08-14,1
"Why is it difficult to pay accounts within BofA? We used to be able to do this and for some reason the functionality has changed. Example: if you have to pay a BofA credit card using your BofA checking account, you need to back out of a dead end ""pay"" button on your CC page, remember the last 4 digits of the account you want to pay, then remember the exact amount you have to pay. It isn't this difficult with other CC companies. Also, Erica is unnecessary garbage. Stop it.",2024-03-04,1
"The reason for a bank/cc app (in my opinion) is to make it easy to navigate to pay your bills. This app has been an absolute problem doing just that. I have questions? Ask Erica. Very vague answeres, and it lands you at the exact spot every time. If it had the option to chat with a representative (a real person) without having to call and sit on hold, it would take a lot of frustration out of paying back money owed.",2024-07-11,1
"Even though I was able to successfully set up my account with this app, I've repeatedly been unsuccessful in being able to sign in, using my correct username and correct password. This app is only capable of doing first half of it's job, leaving the last part of actually signing in, in order to actually have access to what's going on with my account, such as checking the current balance of my account.",2024-09-03,1
"It was very good, but it is getting wost. the main page is advertising like department store. the most important pages tabs like bill pay, bill pay reminders , deposit checks are gone. what a terrible idea. did you discuss before making changes. if yes that means all of you thinking about advertising not functions. I am here to make banking transactions not watching your adds and trying to find where is the bill pay section. terrible fix it. think like humans",2024-02-13,1
"Everytime they upgrade this app, something else breaks. Used to be easy to deposit checks, now you're lucky if it actually goes through. 2 of the last 4 that I've tried depositing were credited, then immediately removed. CS says the check wasn't readable, but it took the picture itself. Today, I tried depositing 3, 2 from the same company, and one of them gets rejected just saying it's not eligible for mobile deposit. App is useless if I have to keep physically going to the bank in person.",2024-01-19,1
"Paid off a car loan of a considerable amount through the app. No confirmation email, text, or anything on the app that shows that the payment was made. Waited until the next day, the amount is still showing as unpaid, no activity of payment whatsoever. I have to click to make another payment in order to get to any sort of view that shows that I made a payment. I went to support, they couldn't help, and couldn't connect me to anyone in the vehicle loan department. Never using BOA for anything.",2024-01-24,1
"Ever since the update I can't deposit a check -- it takes the front picture, but won't take the back one. It's just a black screen. So now the app is forcing me to go to an ATM or branch, the opposite of what an app is supposed to do. Also, now it doesn't always show my transactions -- I have to open/close it multiple times just to get a list. Terrible!",2024-02-11,1

God forbid you try contacting support, you HAVE to go ERICA first, and she's limited at best. Oh well.",2025-01-24,2
"Is there a single UX designer who reviewed this app before it was released? My god there is so much JUNK. I simply want to see my credit balance, my transactions, and my rewards balance. I have to click through so many different menus and statements, etc. to just see my recent purchases. All while being distracted by whatever BS BoA is trying to push to get more money from us. This app needs to be streamlined, bigtime. It makes me want to cancel my card.",2025-01-23,2
What a disaster this app is. Information and actions scattered all over in unrelated groups of menus. Tons of junk items all over the screens. Cant tell where you are expected to click on as sometimes its the whole framed section and sometimes only on text that isnt highlighted. And 75% of time you try to change something and it wont change and just says it cant do that right now and to try again later. I've had to have reps by phone reset my account options because the app wont let me.,2025-02-12,2
After finally figuring out the 4 steps to go to in order to pay my credit cards they went & changed the app again. Now they're called transfers instead of payments & works exactly like a transfer. I can no longer put a NOTE for what I'm paying so can't keep track or organized. Have to go online to add transfer between accounts memo. The neat features it had to distinguish from the website are gone so no point in using it. This app has been destroyed over last 2 years so 10/10 I do NOT recommend.,2024-12-19,2
"The app is limited with the available settings. I tried to stop the monthly balance transfer offers by mail but there is no way to stop them (The paperless option is already enabled) and calling customer service is a joke (45 mins wait) and then when the rep finally answered , I noticed there was 1 to 2 seconds voice lag and she didn't quite understand the issue so had to transfer me to another department who automatically hang up on me... Terrible Service!",2025-01-08,2
"I hate this app. Signing up was difficult, none of my points for Alaska Airlines are showing up. It shouldn't take 2 months for points to show up when I can take a miles for opinions survey for American Airlines and they show up the next day. It should also show a 0 balance when I make a payment. I was billed twice this month because I thought it didn't go through when I looked at it the day after I paid it.",2025-01-29,2
"The most difficult app to use, it is extremely difficult to pay on an account. Currently stuck in an endless loop where it won't let me enter an amount, only gives you an option to ""select amount"", and returns to previous screen without allowing to input amount, onlyvan option to ""select amount"".",2024-12-13,2
"I don't know what you did to the app, but ordering checks is impossible. I'm tempted to bank elsewhere. This is a basic function that every banking app should have. Used to be a great app, but to remove a feature like that and make it impossible to order is the silliest thing I've ever heard of. Opening with a smaller bank come Monday. I literally don't have time for this.",2025-01-26,2

The first time I thought nothing of it (I had made a similar payment a few weeks ago to the same recipient and thought that that's what it was referring to). Not so. My attempt to send only $1000 resulted in $2000 being sent. Just had the same thing almost happen again. Shoddy app.",2025-05-14,2
"It was a great app, easy to track all your spending, make last second payments, keep an eye on any suspicious activity. But the the latest update makes the app no longer compatible with my phone. It's really disapointing that I can no longer use mobile banking just because I have an older phone.",2025-02-23,2
"if you have multiple credit cards through them, the app will not allow you to make new payments, even if you already have your bank info stored. I called 4 times to fix this issue and wasted hours waiting on hold, only to eventually pay the entire balance of the card over the phone and throwing away the cards. Save yourself the trouble and go with any other credit card provider or bank altogether.",2025-03-21,2
"You have too many tabs that complicate making payments. You need to cut down on the steps and simplify paying bills, and credit cards. You should have one tab for payments, one tab for history, one tab for accounts, one tab for activity, tab for earned credits from credit cards. Also a tab to view a detailed spreadsheet showing every payment out, any credits to be redeemed, any incoming funds such as deposits, wire transfers, ect. People are using their cell phones more than their computers.",2025-01-27,2

"Worst app ever!! The interface is horrendous. I couldn't not link my new Alaska CC to my other bank. This was so complicated. Now I can't even see my miles rewards. This is the most user unfriendly App ever from the very beginning, everything is so backward and just a drag. I have the Chase app, so I can definitely tell the difference between a good app and BOA! I think BOA should look at Chase and learn from it. I cannot wait to close both accounts, BOA and Alaska just because of this app.",2024-07-13,2
"Check scanning does not work correctly on my galaxy fold 3. It seems to have trouble lining up the check for taking the picture.

Now I have to decide if I have to change phones or change banks.",2024-08-07,2
"I don't know what's happened to this app, but it went from being a very useful, almost necessity for me to have, to being an absolutely user-antagonistic nightmare. It doesn't save my login information, no matter how many times I select ""remember ID"", my auto fill service works with every other app in my library, but this one, and it is one of the slowest apps I've ever used. Now I just use the mobile site, which is also a steaming pile of uselessness. Thanks, BofA.",2024-11-03,2
"New layout is pretty bad, extra small letters that look confusing. Moreover, added a lot of unnecessary steps when paying credit card/transferring funds between accounts. Why the hell do I have to click ""different amount"" to put in the amount I'm paying out of 3 useless options? And why do I have to go through another step to confirm the amount? I'm not blind, I know the amount I put in!",2024-02-07,2
New version is awful & inconvenient. All of my alert settings are gone. The functionality your credit card bill - 90% of the reason I even use the app - is confusing! The set up makes it look like you're paying from your credit card rather than paying your balance. It doesn't show your minimum payment or due date when setting up the payment bc it's on a different page. Other banks' apps are so much better - more modern and seamless! 👎🏼,2024-06-05,2
"One step away from actually go to the bank. While you can check your balance and transfer, if you have to deposit a check, you have to close all other apps on your phone, even the alarms. With all the updates, you'd think they'd figure out how to have the app take a picture without red lining processing power on phones that are a year old. They refuse to fix problems with the app.",2024-01-15,2
"Used to be able to deposit checks rapidly and flawless. Now with the simpler and automated deposit photography it's slow and impossible. Disappointing Update. Auto photography improved initially. Now back to impossible. Same pixel phone. Same background. Same lighting. But now constantly scolded. Too much light. Use darker background. Move closer. Move further away. Hold steady. I just take photograph manually which works fine. So please remove whatever artificial ""intelligence"" was added",2024-06-01,2
Latest update makes navigation more difficult. I used to be able to access bill pay from the first screen now it is buried 3 layers deep and requires clicking a menu that pops up. Go back to the old interface. Will update my review if they fix this. Why not make it easier to use? I won't be using Bill payer through Bank of America until they change this. Other bank apps are far easier to use.,2024-01-10,2
"The BA app has bugs with the bill pay process be careful. As of 8/13/2024, when you set up a payment on the app you won't see it on the browser. I freaked out and added a payment on the browser because it didnt show on the list. Then both payments go through so you will end up double paying and it still won't show up on your list even after payment just a debit on your checking account.",2024-08-14,2
"Why is it difficult to pay accounts within BofA? We used to be able to do this and for some reason the functionality has changed. Example: if you have to pay a BofA credit card using your BofA checking account, you need to back out of a dead end ""pay"" button on your CC page, remember the last 4 digits of the account you want to pay, then remember the exact amount you have to pay. It isn't this difficult with other CC companies. Also, Erica is unnecessary garbage. Stop it.",2024-03-04,2
"The reason for a bank/cc app (in my opinion) is to make it easy to navigate to pay your bills. This app has been an absolute problem doing just that. I have questions? Ask Erica. Very vague answeres, and it lands you at the exact spot every time. If it had the option to chat with a representative (a real person) without having to call and sit on hold, it would take a lot of frustration out of paying back money owed.",2024-07-11,2
"Even though I was able to successfully set up my account with this app, I've repeatedly been unsuccessful in being able to sign in, using my correct username and correct password.

"It was very good, but it is getting wost. the main page is advertising like department store. the most important pages tabs like bill pay, bill pay reminders , deposit checks are gone. what a terrible idea. did you discuss before making changes. if yes that means all of you thinking about advertising not functions. I am here to make banking transactions not watching your adds and trying to find where is the bill pay section. terrible fix it. think like humans",2024-02-13,2
"Everytime they upgrade this app, something else breaks. Used to be easy to deposit checks, now you're lucky if it actually goes through. 2 of the last 4 that I've tried depositing were credited, then immediately removed. CS says the check wasn't readable, but it took the picture itself. Today, I tried depositing 3, 2 from the same company, and one of them gets rejected just saying it's not eligible for mobile deposit.

Also, now it doesn't always show my transactions -- I have to open/close it multiple times just to get a list. Terrible!",2024-02-11,2
"Unable to switch between linked accounts. I have multiple accounts linked together. Prior to one of the recent updates, I could jump between different accounts Business/Personal.

Horrible. I had them for several years and I was always missing money that I had worked hard for it and my balance would suddenly jump down so I would never be able to save money. One day I lost access to my account and they didn't give me a reason why they shut down my account. They said they would mail me a check for my balance but instead they sent me a bill for a negative balance. This company is a scam I recommend go elsewhere if you want a secure banking system. They will fraud you,2024-12-14,2

I want to make an extra payment on my account & I'm honestly not sure if I was successful. Other apps will allow a photo receipt option. This app does not. I have several credit card accounts, and none are as confusing and difficult as this one. The difficulty I've had using this ap makes me regret using this card for purchases.",2024-09-21,2

"This app doesn't have an option to make principal payments or allow you to pay extra principal on your loans. You have to call them after you make a payment and then have it apply it to your account. This makes paying off loans take longer and costs customers more money in interest. I guess that's good for BOA. Most financial institutions have had these options for years now. It's also very hard to add a new payment method. I think BOA is way behind other companies. Other than that, it's ok",2025-04-24,2
This app is very hard to navigate. it feels like you have to jump through so many non-essential hoops just to make a payment. You are not able to immediately see that your payment has posted to your account. The only way I knew it went through is that when I tried to make another payment (because I didn't think it had gone through) it asked me if I wanted to make another payment today. There is just so much unnecessary information as they try to push more product on you.,2025-03-19,2

Your competitors for other airline cards allow me to easily set up and make payments from external accounts. Curious about the choice preventing new card customers to NOT be able to set up & pay you. Seems like you prefer old hardcopy statements or you are pushing people to open BoA accounts. Obviously not ideal. Hope you fix this. Meanwhile, I'll find a workaround or stop using this card.",2025-01-30,2
"I find this app quite unintuitive. And the fact that I can't set up an auto pay from any place other than a Bank America checking account while I'm on the app is quite stupid. It will allow me to make a payment from my other bank account, but not to set up an auto-pay. I learned that if you go to the website you can actually set it up from another bank. However even then I had a horrible experience with the people there not even being able to tell if I had an auto pay set up.",2025-01-18,2
The app is full of bugs. It gets on verification loops asking for activation/text verification/ password input at least two or three times. Options to manage credit cards are difficult to find and they are located in different parts of the app instead of having everything related to the card in one place. Options like changing the due date should be on the app instead of having to reach out to customer service for it. You should copy what Chase do with their app and Amex online customer service.,2025-03-11,2
"Way too much emphasis on trying to upsell services while actual service is poor. Cant easily see all transactions anymore, pending payments, pending disputes...and to get a hold of a service rep sends you on a wild goose chase around the country, and 1/2 hour hold time each, only to be transferred to a different department. The service and app never used to be this bad.",2025-02-04,2
"I find it ridiculous how you still can't set up notifications for ANY debit card transaction. It has to be a minimum of $50 or $100.

Update:Although the option to lock the card was added. Great! It is by far the most tideous one of all my cards to use. I now have to call to get an authorization code to be able to unlock the card instead receiving an email or txt. The wait times are often horrendous and inconvenient when trying to purchase something. Please fix.,2024-12-30,2

Each time you want to pay a couple bills, it takes minimum 4 clicks just to get to the screen to pay someone, and then you can only pay one at a time, and after you pay, it is another 4 clicks to pay the next bill. It is also a big let down that you can't reconcile receipts thru the app. The app used to be a lot better, they need to evaluate their user interface for ease of use, or people will stop using it.",2024-08-29,2

Existing problem for years. This section needs to be reworked. Hoping the dev team sees this!",2024-03-12,2
Bill payment from an account other than BoA is impossible to set up in the app. The payment and transfer menu has not been updated in multiple years and takes multiple steps to get done. Overall a mediocre experience at best. All the other major banking apps (including some smaller banks) are decades ahead of BoA's ancient system.,2024-01-23,2
"Not great. The app would not allow me to deposit a check, took 4 attempts to get app to do the front and back of check another 2 times to get the account to deposit to then even after 9 attempts it NEVER NEVER allowed me to put in amount of check. This is in no way convenient. By the way it worked before the update, if this is an example of you listening and your idea of improvement then please stop improving and listening, sorry but you aren't good at it. Ridiculous situation. Erica is a joke",2024-03-18,2

This app's user interface is incredibly frustrating. Simple tasks require far too many taps and feel unnecessarily cumbersome. The amount of friction in navigating and completing basic actions (especially paying a credit card) is surprising for an app from such a large bank.

Now it just says ""debit card has been used online, check for details"" so now EVERY SINGLE charge has to be checked to keep in top of any potential fraud. It's incredibly frustrating.",2025-05-21,3

What a disaster this app is. Information and actions scattered all over in unrelated groups of menus. Tons of junk items all over the screens. Cant tell where you are expected to click on as sometimes its the whole framed section and sometimes only on text that isnt highlighted.

After finally figuring out the 4 steps to go to in order to pay my credit cards they went & changed the app again. Now they're called transfers instead of payments & works exactly like a transfer. I can no longer put a NOTE for what I'm paying so can't keep track or organized. Have to go online to add transfer between accounts memo. The neat features it had to distinguish from the website are gone so no point in using it. This app has been destroyed over last 2 years so 10/10 I do NOT recommend.,2024-12-19,3

"Why is it difficult to pay accounts within BofA? We used to be able to do this and for some reason the functionality has changed. Example: if you have to pay a BofA credit card using your BofA checking account, you need to back out of a dead end ""pay"" button on your CC page, remember the last 4 digits of the account you want to pay, then remember the exact amount you have to pay. It isn't this difficult with other CC companies. Also, Erica is unnecessary garbage. Stop it.",2024-03-04,3
"The reason for a bank/cc app (in my opinion) is to make it easy to navigate to pay your bills. This app has been an absolute problem doing just that. I have questions? Ask Erica. Very vague answeres, and it lands you at the exact spot every time. If it had the option to chat with a representative (a real person) without having to call and sit on hold, it would take a lot of frustration out of paying back money owed.",2024-07-11,3
"Even though I was able to successfully set up my account with this app, I've repeatedly been unsuccessful in being able to sign in, using my correct username and correct password.

I am here to make banking transactions not watching your adds and trying to find where is the bill pay section. terrible fix it. think like humans",2024-02-13,3
"Everytime they upgrade this app, something else breaks. Used to be easy to deposit checks, now you're lucky if it actually goes through. 2 of the last 4 that I've tried depositing were credited, then immediately removed. CS says the check wasn't readable, but it took the picture itself. Today, I tried depositing 3, 2 from the same company, and one of them gets rejected just saying it's not eligible for mobile deposit.

Horrible. I had them for several years and I was always missing money that I had worked hard for it and my balance would suddenly jump down so I would never be able to save money. One day I lost access to my account and they didn't give me a reason why they shut down my account. They said they would mail me a check for my balance but instead they sent me a bill for a negative balance. This company is a scam I recommend go elsewhere if you want a secure banking system. They will fraud you,2024-12-14,3

"This app doesn't have an option to make principal payments or allow you to pay extra principal on your loans. You have to call them after you make a payment and then have it apply it to your account. This makes paying off loans take longer and costs customers more money in interest. I guess that's good for BOA. Most financial institutions have had these options for years now. It's also very hard to add a new payment method. I think BOA is way behind other companies. Other than that, it's ok",2025-04-24,3
This app is very hard to navigate. it feels like you have to jump through so many non-essential hoops just to make a payment. You are not able to immediately see that your payment has posted to your account. The only way I knew it went through is that when I tried to make another payment (because I didn't think it had gone through) it asked me if I wanted to make another payment today. There is just so much unnecessary information as they try to push more product on you.,2025-03-19,3

Your competitors for other airline cards allow me to easily set up and make payments from external accounts. Curious about the choice preventing new card customers to NOT be able to set up & pay you. Seems like you prefer old hardcopy statements or you are pushing people to open BoA accounts. Obviously not ideal. Hope you fix this. Meanwhile, I'll find a workaround or stop using this card.",2025-01-30,3
"I find this app quite unintuitive. And the fact that I can't set up an auto pay from any place other than a Bank America checking account while I'm on the app is quite stupid. It will allow me to make a payment from my other bank account, but not to set up an auto-pay. I learned that if you go to the website you can actually set it up from another bank. However even then I had a horrible experience with the people there not even being able to tell if I had an auto pay set up.",2025-01-18,3
The app is full of bugs. It gets on verification loops asking for activation/text verification/ password input at least two or three times. Options to manage credit cards are difficult to find and they are located in different parts of the app instead of having everything related to the card in one place. Options like changing the due date should be on the app instead of having to reach out to customer service for it. You should copy what Chase do with their app and Amex online customer service.,2025-03-11,3
"Way too much emphasis on trying to upsell services while actual service is poor. Cant easily see all transactions anymore, pending payments, pending disputes...and to get a hold of a service rep sends you on a wild goose chase around the country, and 1/2 hour hold time each, only to be transferred to a different department. The service and app never used to be this bad.",2025-02-04,3
"I find it ridiculous how you still can't set up notifications for ANY debit card transaction. It has to be a minimum of $50 or $100.

Update:Although the option to lock the card was added. Great! It is by far the most tideous one of all my cards to use. I now have to call to get an authorization code to be able to unlock the card instead receiving an email or txt. The wait times are often horrendous and inconvenient when trying to purchase something. Please fix.,2024-12-30,3

"It is infuriating how many clicks this app requires to pay bills. Each time you want to pay a couple bills, it takes minimum 4 clicks just to get to the screen to pay someone, and then you can only pay one at a time, and after you pay, it is another 4 clicks to pay the next bill. It is also a big let down that you can't reconcile receipts thru the app. The app used to be a lot better, they need to evaluate their user interface for ease of use, or people will stop using it.",2024-08-29,3
"I have been with BOA for a LONG time, and their app, along with their banking security has steadily declined over the last few years. I cannot even navigate their bill pay on the app any longer. If they believe they are making things easier for those, like myself, who are not tech savvy, they are WRONG. Additionally, they have sent out the same checks several times, through bill pay, draining my account. Calling a rep proved to be futile because the person helping me was incompetent.

I'm frustrated with this app. I used to have a mortgage and a credit card about 20 years ago with BofA. Both were closed. Recently got a new card. The app shows my the new info but when I go to pay the card it shows the old card that's been cancelled for years now. Also had to call to remove old email addresses twice.

Taking it down a star or two as the app seems to digress with each update.

This app's user interface is incredibly frustrating. Simple tasks require far too many taps and feel unnecessarily cumbersome.

Now it just says ""debit card has been used online, check for details"" so now EVERY SINGLE charge has to be checked to keep in top of any potential fraud. It's incredibly frustrating.",2025-05-21,4

Then, a never-ending 'BofA isn't Responding' Caption follows & I just LEAVE bcuz i CAN'T SEE trying to continue using it. At this point, it's only serving to take up data & save information from my device; I'm gonna 'uninstall' and do business elsewhere.",2025-05-19,4
"Generally, I agree with most reviewers who complain about this app's performance: slow, non-intuitive, difficult to navigate. For me, the most frustrating issue is trying to deposit checks via this App! I admit that I have shaky hands but even after I take the photo myself the App suddenly says, ""Oops. Something has gone wrong. Try again later."" Every time. Useless!",2025-04-12,4
"I avoid using their card and app for 90% of my purchases because the app doesn’t offer an option to automatically pay the full statement balance, unlike Amex, Chase, or even basic credit unions. This design increases the risk of interest charges, especially when busy or distracted. It feels like a trap, and for that reason, I can’t rely on this card and app for everyday use or recommend it... no.",2025-05-10,4
"Needs a dark mode. Check deposit does not always work and is very finicky to use. ""Less light is needed"", ""More light is needed"", ""Move closer"", ""Move back"" over and over and never lets you deposit the damn check. Getting worse. ""Insights"" is just a platform for ads, now. When I sign in to do banking, I do NOT want to have to click through a goddamn ad first! This app is the definition of ""enshitification"", now.",2025-04-19,4
"this app SUCKS if you have multiple accounts!!!! I have 3 accounts, and when you try to log out of one and into another it kicks you out MULTIPLE times as you try to log in using your finger print. I have to physically enter my log in info manually to get into the next account. VERY ANNOYING when I'm trying to bounce between the 3 accounts. This has been a problem for over a year.....you would think they would fix this issue by now. Horrible app!",2025-03-22,4
"I have been using BOA billpay for over a decade. It used to be a reliable workhorse. Recently, BOA has become more aggressive at pushing their immature less than Beta quality agent. Erica is stupid and slows me down. BOA does not use AI to help me navigate its menus, which would be easy and low risk to implement. I spent three hours setting up ACH transfers because the prompts are counterintuitive.",2025-03-28,4
Terrible. I ordered the Alaska miles credit card and set up through B of A app I messed around with it for about 45 minutes and couldn't figure out how to even add my bank account to pay the credit card fee. I ended canceling the credit card shortly after because the app was too frustrating. Shame bc i would have liked to have that card. I'm in my 40s and moderately tech savvy and use 10ish online banking and finance apps. This is by far the worst. not intuitive nor user friendly,2025-04-18,4
"This app is very glitchy. When I try to change between accounts it logs you out. You log in again, click to switch accounts, logs you out. Do it 5 more times and finally you're in. Some days you could click it for an hour and it will log you out every time. Sometimes it works on the first try like it's an actual functioning app. But most days after about 3 attempts I walk away from banking today and try again tomorrow. If there were an alternative app, I would most definitely scratch this one!",2025-03-16,4
"this is the most complicated bank application I have ever used. any time task, like making a payment, setting up auto pay, adding a new bank account to pay you credit card with, EVERYTHING requires an extensive amount of time trying to figure out where and how to do it. careful, they won't let you pay your credit card with a new bank account until they send small deposits to your account to ""Verify"" which takes 3 days. this is to make you late on your payment, don't be fooled. worst bank",2025-05-14,4
"By far the WORST banking app I've used (out of the 9 I use on a regular basis). Set up paperless billing from the get-go, but then never received a statement, and couldn't set up a payment account via the mobile app (had to be in a web browser). Just discovered you can't even make a custom payment amount through the mobile app - only the statement balance or the minimum amount due. What a joke! Why even have a mobile app???",2025-05-14,4
"Since last update, the app does not perform well. It keeps crashing. It becam e very slow. It is now a year later since my review above. The slow condition has not changed. It might even be a somewhat slower. I use the app several times per day. It is imposible to make Zelle payments. It just keeps frozen after the option for Zelle is selected.",2025-03-22,4
I have no idea how this terrible app has 4 stars. Can't send yourself an email confirming a balance payment. The payment record doesn't show up for up to two days. So you can't tell if it's already paid or not. I frequently find myself overpaying because of this basic stuff that is just non-existent.,2025-04-04,4
"Horrible user interface, not easy to navigate through statements or set up auto pay to a credit card, whoever designed the app needs to fired. Update: nothing has changed, still the worst banking app in existence. tried to pay the bill and it defaulted back to the home screen. no confirmation, nothing. really horrible",2025-03-22,4
it's not just the app it's the bank itself too. regarding the app you can only view your FICO score but you cannot get anything else like reports about new accounts dark web searching if for seeing if your information or security was compromised. Don't be misled by their interest rate which is almost zero it's 0.01 which means 100th of 1% not 1%. they do have a good mobile check deposit option.,2025-05-01,4
"Seems after a recent update, the app now crashes and restarts going back to login when taking a photo of a check for a deposit. Does it consistently, have rebooted phone, app is updated. Have to resort to using the app on my *gasp* ipad to do the same. Otherwise, I have no problems with the app. Samsung Galaxy S24FE, TMobile, Android 14, OneUI 6.1. Otherwise I have no problem with the app, does what a banking app should do. Unfortunately I need it for depositing checks more than anything.",2025-03-20,4
I love the app prior to the changes both on website and here. it was much more user friendly. Now you have to use two screens and when you make a payment it never puts you back to the location you made payment from it puts you back to the top and then you have to scroll all the way back down to the bottom. it is not user friendly at all. It also makes it difficult to transfer from one Bank of America to My accounts at other Banks suck as saving and checking account.,2025-02-19,4
"I have never used such an awful mobile app for banking. You can't set up a custom value for monthly auto-pay (likely intentional), setting up credit payments is extremely odd and could only be done through the website page, and the general interface looks like it's been programmed by a government lackey. Feels like an app from 2012. Never banking with y'all after I pay off this promotional card. I may just pay it off tomorrow so I don't have to deal with the poorly designed user interface.",2025-02-06,4
"Is it me or does it seem odd when an app offers a feature but said features aren't working properly or have stopped working altogether. I'm referring to the My Balance and the App Deposit features. There was a time when I used both of these all the time but overtime, the My Balance feature no longer works for me and the App Deposit stops working after I snap a picture of the 2nd side. God forbid you try contacting support, you HAVE to go ERICA first, and she's limited at best. Oh well.",2025-01-24,4
"Is there a single UX designer who reviewed this app before it was released? My god there is so much JUNK. I simply want to see my credit balance, my transactions, and my rewards balance. I have to click through so many different menus and statements, etc. to just see my recent purchases. All while being distracted by whatever BS BoA is trying to push to get more money from us. This app needs to be streamlined, bigtime. It makes me want to cancel my card.",2025-01-23,4
What a disaster this app is. Information and actions scattered all over in unrelated groups of menus. Tons of junk items all over the screens. Cant tell where you are expected to click on as sometimes its the whole framed section and sometimes only on text that isnt highlighted. And 75% of time you try to change something and it wont change and just says it cant do that right now and to try again later. I've had to have reps by phone reset my account options because the app wont let me.,2025-02-12,4
After finally figuring out the 4 steps to go to in order to pay my credit cards they went & changed the app again. Now they're called transfers instead of payments & works exactly like a transfer. I can no longer put a NOTE for what I'm paying so can't keep track or organized. Have to go online to add transfer between accounts memo. The neat features it had to distinguish from the website are gone so no point in using it. This app has been destroyed over last 2 years so 10/10 I do NOT recommend.,2024-12-19,4
"The app is limited with the available settings. I tried to stop the monthly balance transfer offers by mail but there is no way to stop them (The paperless option is already enabled) and calling customer service is a joke (45 mins wait) and then when the rep finally answered , I noticed there was 1 to 2 seconds voice lag and she didn't quite understand the issue so had to transfer me to another department who automatically hang up on me... Terrible Service!",2025-01-08,4
"I hate this app. Signing up was difficult, none of my points for Alaska Airlines are showing up. It shouldn't take 2 months for points to show up when I can take a miles for opinions survey for American Airlines and they show up the next day. It should also show a 0 balance when I make a payment. I was billed twice this month because I thought it didn't go through when I looked at it the day after I paid it.",2025-01-29,4
"The most difficult app to use, it is extremely difficult to pay on an account. Currently stuck in an endless loop where it won't let me enter an amount, only gives you an option to ""select amount"", and returns to previous screen without allowing to input amount, onlyvan option to ""select amount"".",2024-12-13,4
"I don't know what you did to the app, but ordering checks is impossible. I'm tempted to bank elsewhere. This is a basic function that every banking app should have.

I literally don't have time for this.",2025-01-26,4
"Every time I make a payment with Zelle, it submits the request twice. I click the submit button once and get the message about having recently made a similar payment.

My attempt to send only $1000 resulted in $2000 being sent. Just had the same thing almost happen again. Shoddy app.",2025-05-14,4
"It was a great app, easy to track all your spending, make last second payments, keep an eye on any suspicious activity. But the the latest update makes the app no longer compatible with my phone. It's really disapointing that I can no longer use mobile banking just because I have an older phone.",2025-02-23,4
"if you have multiple credit cards through them, the app will not allow you to make new payments, even if you already have your bank info stored. I called 4 times to fix this issue and wasted hours waiting on hold, only to eventually pay the entire balance of the card over the phone and throwing away the cards. Save yourself the trouble and go with any other credit card provider or bank altogether.",2025-03-21,4
"You have too many tabs that complicate making payments. You need to cut down on the steps and simplify paying bills, and credit cards. You should have one tab for payments, one tab for history, one tab for accounts, one tab for activity, tab for earned credits from credit cards.

People are using their cell phones more than their computers.",2025-01-27,4
"This used to be a really good app. After the last update when you open the app it says wifi not connected even if it is. After trying a second time it connects. Also check deposit is not working!

"Worst app ever!! The interface is horrendous. I couldn't not link my new Alaska CC to my other bank. This was so complicated. Now I can't even see my miles rewards. This is the most user unfriendly App ever from the very beginning, everything is so backward and just a drag. I have the Chase app, so I can definitely tell the difference between a good app and BOA! I think BOA should look at Chase and learn from it. I cannot wait to close both accounts, BOA and Alaska just because of this app.",2024-07-13,4
"Check scanning does not work correctly on my galaxy fold 3. It seems to have trouble lining up the check for taking the picture.

Now I have to decide if I have to change phones or change banks.",2024-08-07,4
"I don't know what's happened to this app, but it went from being a very useful, almost necessity for me to have, to being an absolutely user-antagonistic nightmare. It doesn't save my login information, no matter how many times I select ""remember ID"", my auto fill service works with every other app in my library, but this one, and it is one of the slowest apps I've ever used. Now I just use the mobile site, which is also a steaming pile of uselessness. Thanks, BofA.",2024-11-03,4
"New layout is pretty bad, extra small letters that look confusing. Moreover, added a lot of unnecessary steps when paying credit card/transferring funds between accounts. Why the hell do I have to click ""different amount"" to put in the amount I'm paying out of 3 useless options? And why do I have to go through another step to confirm the amount? I'm not blind, I know the amount I put in!",2024-02-07,4
New version is awful & inconvenient. All of my alert settings are gone. The functionality your credit card bill - 90% of the reason I even use the app - is confusing! The set up makes it look like you're paying from your credit card rather than paying your balance. It doesn't show your minimum payment or due date when setting up the payment bc it's on a different page. Other banks' apps are so much better - more modern and seamless! 👎🏼,2024-06-05,4
"One step away from actually go to the bank. While you can check your balance and transfer, if you have to deposit a check, you have to close all other apps on your phone, even the alarms. With all the updates, you'd think they'd figure out how to have the app take a picture without red lining processing power on phones that are a year old. They refuse to fix problems with the app.",2024-01-15,4
"Used to be able to deposit checks rapidly and flawless. Now with the simpler and automated deposit photography it's slow and impossible. Disappointing Update. Auto photography improved initially. Now back to impossible. Same pixel phone. Same background. Same lighting. But now constantly scolded. Too much light. Use darker background. Move closer. Move further away. Hold steady. I just take photograph manually which works fine. So please remove whatever artificial ""intelligence"" was added",2024-06-01,4
Latest update makes navigation more difficult. I used to be able to access bill pay from the first screen now it is buried 3 layers deep and requires clicking a menu that pops up. Go back to the old interface. Will update my review if they fix this. Why not make it easier to use? I won't be using Bill payer through Bank of America until they change this. Other bank apps are far easier to use.,2024-01-10,4
"The BA app has bugs with the bill pay process be careful. As of 8/13/2024, when you set up a payment on the app you won't see it on the browser. I freaked out and added a payment on the browser because it didnt show on the list. Then both payments go through so you will end up double paying and it still won't show up on your list even after payment just a debit on your checking account.",2024-08-14,4
"Why is it difficult to pay accounts within BofA? We used to be able to do this and for some reason the functionality has changed. Example: if you have to pay a BofA credit card using your BofA checking account, you need to back out of a dead end ""pay"" button on your CC page, remember the last 4 digits of the account you want to pay, then remember the exact amount you have to pay. It isn't this difficult with other CC companies. Also, Erica is unnecessary garbage. Stop it.",2024-03-04,4
"The reason for a bank/cc app (in my opinion) is to make it easy to navigate to pay your bills. This app has been an absolute problem doing just that. I have questions? Ask Erica. Very vague answeres, and it lands you at the exact spot every time. If it had the option to chat with a representative (a real person) without having to call and sit on hold, it would take a lot of frustration out of paying back money owed.",2024-07-11,4
"Even though I was able to successfully set up my account with this app, I've repeatedly been unsuccessful in being able to sign in, using my correct username and correct password.

"It was very good, but it is getting wost. the main page is advertising like department store. the most important pages tabs like bill pay, bill pay reminders , deposit checks are gone. what a terrible idea. did you discuss before making changes. if yes that means all of you thinking about advertising not functions. I am here to make banking transactions not watching your adds and trying to find where is the bill pay section. terrible fix it. think like humans",2024-02-13,4
"Everytime they upgrade this app, something else breaks. Used to be easy to deposit checks, now you're lucky if it actually goes through. 2 of the last 4 that I've tried depositing were credited, then immediately removed. CS says the check wasn't readable, but it took the picture itself.

Also, now it doesn't always show my transactions -- I have to open/close it multiple times just to get a list. Terrible!",2024-02-11,4

Horrible. I had them for several years and I was always missing money that I had worked hard for it and my balance would suddenly jump down so I would never be able to save money. One day I lost access to my account and they didn't give me a reason why they shut down my account. They said they would mail me a check for my balance but instead they sent me a bill for a negative balance. This company is a scam I recommend go elsewhere if you want a secure banking system. They will fraud you,2024-12-14,4

"This app doesn't have an option to make principal payments or allow you to pay extra principal on your loans. You have to call them after you make a payment and then have it apply it to your account. This makes paying off loans take longer and costs customers more money in interest.

Other than that, it's ok",2025-04-24,4
This app is very hard to navigate. it feels like you have to jump through so many non-essential hoops just to make a payment. You are not able to immediately see that your payment has posted to your account. The only way I knew it went through is that when I tried to make another payment (because I didn't think it had gone through) it asked me if I wanted to make another payment today. There is just so much unnecessary information as they try to push more product on you.,2025-03-19,4

"I find this app quite unintuitive. And the fact that I can't set up an auto pay from any place other than a Bank America checking account while I'm on the app is quite stupid. It will allow me to make a payment from my other bank account, but not to set up an auto-pay. I learned that if you go to the website you can actually set it up from another bank. However even then I had a horrible experience with the people there not even being able to tell if I had an auto pay set up.",2025-01-18,4
The app is full of bugs. It gets on verification loops asking for activation/text verification/ password input at least two or three times. Options to manage credit cards are difficult to find and they are located in different parts of the app instead of having everything related to the card in one place. Options like changing the due date should be on the app instead of having to reach out to customer service for it. You should copy what Chase do with their app and Amex online customer service.,2025-03-11,4
"Way too much emphasis on trying to upsell services while actual service is poor. Cant easily see all transactions anymore, pending payments, pending disputes...and to get a hold of a service rep sends you on a wild goose chase around the country, and 1/2 hour hold time each, only to be transferred to a different department. The service and app never used to be this bad.",2025-02-04,4
"I find it ridiculous how you still can't set up notifications for ANY debit card transaction. It has to be a minimum of $50 or $100.

I found out the hard way that each time this occurred, one of the bill payments had fallen off. So the end result was late payments, late fees charged to me, and a hit to my credit score. Thanks B of A. 😞",2024-08-19,4
"It is infuriating how many clicks this app requires to pay bills. Each time you want to pay a couple bills, it takes minimum 4 clicks just to get to the screen to pay someone, and then you can only pay one at a time, and after you pay, it is another 4 clicks to pay the next bill. It is also a big let down that you can't reconcile receipts thru the app. The app used to be a lot better, they need to evaluate their user interface for ease of use, or people will stop using it.",2024-08-29,4

Additionally, they have sent out the same checks several times, through bill pay, draining my account. Calling a rep proved to be futile because the person helping me was incompetent.

The app shows my the new info but when I go to pay the card it shows the old card that's been cancelled for years now. Also had to call to remove old email addresses twice. Still has an old one listed but at least the new one is the primary now. I just don't find the app to be user friendly. I can't pay my credit card from it.,2024-11-08,4

Now it's just annoying to find current recurring payments and activity in the app. I still am not sure how my BoA credit card payments are managed and how to view them, but at least they're happening. I think it's because payments and transfers are separate, I guess? Everything should be in the payments section. I don't care how it works in the background, make it simple again.",2025-01-20,4
"I don't like that when you make a payment. It doesn't show up on your account for a long time. My other credit cards send me an email immediately, and it shows in my transactions that I made a payment. So the problem is if it errors in the middle of a payment I can't tell if it went through or not because it doesn't show on my account immediately. I might not get an email about it until it's already past due. It took 4 days to post payment after I initiated it.",2025-02-04,4
"I don't know what's happening with the app. From 6 months until now the app has been getting bugs and errors, when I get to the Pay section and mostly Zelle section, the app slows down, stops working, closes with a 'The app has stopped working' and 'The app doesn't answer' pop ups. I literally have to force stop it like 3 times for it to work properly and it gets annoying. I stopped using for payments because it's not working properly at all.",2025-01-27,4
"This app is very confusing or maybe it's me I don't know, but anytime I want to find any transactions I don't care if it's a week to a month ago I cant find nothing in the app, and I know I've used it. I would love for it to be just like a banks mobile app where it shows the balance, payment due, how much and list any or all transactions listed below including payments, but I'm sure all those click here, click there screens couldn't be condensed.",2024-09-16,4
"Automatic Notification of Card Usage would be a great tool. Also, being able to see transactions as they process, from pending to paid, in the app would be very helpful for managing all bill payments. Waiting for a statement sometimes takes too long & being on the phone is monotonous, time consuming. If these were on the menu the app would be worth having on my phone and more efficient for customers. Thank you for listening.",2024-02-16,4
"No matter what we did, the app said it could not read the information on the back of a check we are trying to deposit. We have successfully used this feature Many times in the past, but it does Not appear to be working at this time. We even tried black blue and gray background, adding and removing lighting, darkening the signature, and the app said it was not able to read the information. I'd like to add a picture, but do not see an option to add a picture. TIA for any help or repairs to the ap",2024-07-10,4
"This app has been one that I have used more often than any other app. We have several accounts with BOA, including credit card accounts. The automatic payments setup has been difficult and hard to follow up on to be sure payments have been made on time. Using external bank accounts either for payments or transfers to BOA accounts, or vice versa, has been an issue as well. I set up the same external account several times because it disappeared either from the mobile App or the PC website or both.",2024-09-24,4
"It's good, does the job, maybe could make it a little easier to schedule transfers but it does the job. The notifications don't work correctly, you can turn off certain options but still get notifications on the app. The text message alert about a direct deposit being put into your account does not work correctly on Android, I never had an issue before until an update maybe a year or so ago and have not gotten a text message notification about direct deposit",2024-03-03,4

Annoying.",2024-02-04,4
"Been a BOA customer for 25yrs and using online banking since its start. The last 5yrs or so, there's really been a lack of innovation in the app and it's taken a step back. Examples: It used to take literally 2 clicks to pay my CC bill. Nowadays it takes many more. Simple things like picking the source of funds to pay with are not defaulted in. The payment amount used to default to the CC balance, but now I have to type it in. These small things save time and reduce errors but are long gone.",2024-01-14,4
"Always had great experience with BOA. They really watch out for you when it alerting someone of unusual activity. Update: I had to remove two stars for bounce fees and closing an account because of overdue BOUNCE FEES. One of my accts was negative due to the bounce fees that were added because of Netflix and Google trying to take there mesely 12.00 and 1.99 when I lost my job. They allowed them to keep trying to get their money and, every time, added another bounce fee then closed my account.",2024-08-08,4

"Normally I am very pleased with the BofA app but more recently I have been having problems with it. It freezes or stops working properly. Often, bill pay can't be use or other information is unavailable and I have exit and return later to complete what I wanted to do. That is very inconvenient and annoying. When the system works, it's great but when it freezes as it has been doing, then not so great.",2024-09-20,4

However, it's not intuitive, you have to dig at times to find things, and I can't turn off features I don't want to see/use, such as Erica (acct insights feature). I don't want your extra services, I don't want to be shown what you deem important or the monthly product. So, quit unnecessary advertising/pushing of ""services"" I don't want. Want to be useful? Make the app intuitive. Sounds simple, right?",2024-11-20,4
"Great app for banking, been using it since I became a BoA member in 2021. This past year, it has been crashing the first time I try signing in, requiring me to sign in twice before the app stays open for me to check my account. It's a sleek app, but does get frustrating having to sign in twice each time I want to look at my account.",2024-01-18,4
I wish the app would reflect the new balance immediately after you make a credit card payment like the Citi card app does. This would eliminate a lot of confusion. I just double paid my bank of America credit card balance because I wasn't sure if it recognized that I made the initial payment. Now I'll have to contact the them and get it all straightened out in the morning 😠.,2024-10-22,4

Is there an update or something i can do? Please!!! Thank you!",2024-08-01,4
"Used to be better. I only had to select a single option to pay off a credit card in the statements page from my checking account. They now make you jump through an ever more increasing number of hoops to do it. You now have to go to Pay & Transfer > Pay Bills > Add Payee > Add a Company, and then put in the credit account number and full amount to pay (you'll have to remember from memory or else it erases). This can eventually lead to some people being late in their credit card payments.",2024-03-11,4
"I have been with BOA for many years. It's my primary bank. My question is, why doesn't this app allow a customer to set up automatic payments without having to use a desktop computer. Even contacting a BOA rep on the phone is of no help. All other credit cards I have with other institutions have offered this option for years. It's not rocket science!! BOA is simply behind the times by not offering this option on its mobile app. Maybe it's about time to get with the program. I do!",2024-05-14,4
"Great app. Makes my banking really easy and convenient. No unnecessary protocols. However, a recent update removed my access to my Fico score, which used to feature under the life plan section. For foreign clients, this makes it impossible to follow how well we are doing with the management of our credits since we don't have social security numbers and can't use our Itin's to gain access. I think this should be looked into. Thanks.",2024-01-06,4
"I wanted to be sure my credit card bill was set to pay. The app showed the full amount due and no trace of a payment scheduled. So I set it to pay, and it said I already was scheduled for the same amount so I cancelled. Searched everywhere on app and nothing about a scheduled payment. Repeated then backed out. Is there a way to see a scheduled payment if there is one?? I need to know. It should be available information.",2024-12-10,4
"The app seems to have a weak side of not showing real-time balance when transferring money to a different credit card. B/se of this, I've received a number of notifications for ""available balance below the minimum""! I hope you can fix it! Again and again, the issue of not showing the real-time actual balance has caused me to get my account balance below minimum. I'm not sure if there's any penalties for such mishaps. However, the app has to fix this problem.",2024-01-10,4
"Far ahead of other banks' apps that I've used. Everything works really well. UPDATE 2/1/2024 The format change just made in the app is a few steps backward. The order of the list of my accounts is now changed and is very inconvenient. I need to be able to rearrange the list. I can't believe that's not possible on the account page. Also, the font displaying the accounts and balances is much smaller than previously. It's less esthetically pleasing and less useful.",2024-02-01,4
"There are too many steps just to complete simple tasks. The changes made were unnecessary and troublesome. Not happy with the changes.

Then tap on password then the whole thing comes up when I tap on it it doesn't go in so I type the first two letters of my password and then delete it and then it automatically goes in and I can log in. Every time, that's what I got to do. And have no idea how I figured out how to do it... It's ridiculous. I have like 10 credit cards in like eight apps. This is the only one who does it.

I have tried to use some of the features in the Budget section, which becomes useless to me since trying update increased housing costs and other edit features seem unavailable.

Also, when I received a large sum of money to my account, there was a check for 50k that cleared on my end, but the recipient never got it.

Why do I have to swipe it away twice? And you can't find answers online.

The only one that mentions an app asks if you can close your account through the app. Where are answers?",2024-05-12,4
Taking it down a star or two as the app seems to digress with each update. Notable degradations include worse check-deposit imaging/reliability and deteriorated navigation/site architecture making it more difficult to find and execute tasks like Start ATM withdrawal.

Since the last update a couple of days ago it doesn't allow you to deposit checks it doesn't allow you to scan both sides of the check it'll either allow you to scan the front or the back and then it locks up either roll it back to the previous version or fix this one. Thank you,2024-02-15,4
"Back in 2020 I rated this app a 4.5, but with the random changes, it has become more difficult to use and often difficult to find things about your account. Some of the more commonly used functions where changed to use a different process. You eventually figure things out, but the effort is high and it is still ugly to use. I rate this as a 3.0 now.

"Could still be clearer, where you're navigating, but it's unlikely you'll end up in the completely wrong area. (Something simple to implement could be a link from ""bills paid"" to ""pay this payee again"" area. I often find myself in a receipts area when I just need to pay bills; that's what I use the app for almost exclusively) Anyway, if you're willing to give in and talk to the customer service AI or faceless customer service person it's mostly alright. Accept the future.",2024-04-30,4
Right now the app is working perfectly and the alerts on use are being delivered. It was surprising that it took a week after set up for the alerts to start happening. It made me wonder if I had done it incorrectly. A note saying it takes up to 7 days for the app to start reporting would have been comforting.,2024-04-26,4
"its convenient for quick things but its not as informative as I'd like. No history, not much transfer options. Two years after I can use my phone for access code and the inbox history is now fixed. I love that I can see my balance after each transaction. True banking on hand!👌🏾",2024-02-08,4
"Pretty seemless. Have had a few glitches in the past, but fixed rather quickly. Overall, its a much better app that city credit union. Has features like card lock, mobile deposits, immediate money transfers and zelles, transactions searches, clear and visibile font, update information or order new card right through the app, and you can file a dispute through the app.",2024-09-29,4
"Many of the latest updates help make the app easier to navigate which is great. But I have noticed a delay in postings. I check the account to check to make sure I made a payment but nothing shows. So I make another payment, check a day later and now both payments show and went thru!",2024-02-08,4
"Update 5/2024 : Same as previous post. It's still not easy to view transactions. Review 7/2023: Works quickly and efficiently, transferring funds into different accounts. Also, I would like to see a better transaction view than changing the date and saving it. It would be useful to have a continuous scrolling of transactions and not have to adjust each month. Otherwise, it's a great app.",2024-05-06,4
"I really like using the app, it makes seeing my balances and paying cr. cards easily by transferring payments. I can arrange my accounts on one page for easy access. See my statements and print out a copy. Also I can access Zelle and send money. However 2 things I am not happy about, 1. I can't see my sent Zelle history when I open Zelle from the app. And 2. Erica's problems understanding many questions I ask to to access information I need to see. This is not helpful & I have to call.",2024-11-12,4
"The app is good, but I wish you would put back the option to see your whole password when typing it. That helps people with disabilities to know they have typed it in correctly. Now I must type very slowly and still can't be sure if I've gotten it right. I've had to change my password many times because the app does not allow repeated mistakes. It's been very frustrating. Please put the option back on.",2024-08-04,4
"Was it only a glitch or did they restore the functions that were missing after the latest update? (3/23/24 - The revised Bill Pay user interface is lousy. Much harder to navigate and the best part of the calendar view (total outgoing per day) has been removed! Change it back, like you did the last time you messed with this.) As of 3/26/24 the bill pay UI is back to normal.",2024-03-26,4
This app's user interface is incredibly frustrating. Simple tasks require far too many taps and feel unnecessarily cumbersome. The amount of friction in navigating and completing basic actions (especially paying a credit card) is surprising for an app from such a large bank. It honestly feels like it was designed by a team with limited experience in UX/UI principles. I hate when I have to use it.,2025-05-03,5
"Recently they changed the mobile alerts for charges made online. Before it would show you the dollar amount, so if you remember your charges you could see it and know where it came from, or if you saw an amount you don't recognize, you could then go into the app and look where that charge came from. Now it just says ""debit card has been used online, check for details"" so now EVERY SINGLE charge has to be checked to keep in top of any potential fraud. It's incredibly frustrating.",2025-05-21,5
"The app is ok, but it could use a few improvements. I like to manage my net worth on the app as well, and the app doesn't calculate it correctly. It double counts one of my internal accounts.

Then, a never-ending 'BofA isn't Responding' Caption follows & I just LEAVE bcuz i CAN'T SEE trying to continue using it.

"Generally, I agree with most reviewers who complain about this app's performance: slow, non-intuitive, difficult to navigate. For me, the most frustrating issue is trying to deposit checks via this App! I admit that I have shaky hands but even after I take the photo myself the App suddenly says, ""Oops. Something has gone wrong. Try again later."" Every time. Useless!",2025-04-12,5
"I avoid using their card and app for 90% of my purchases because the app doesn’t offer an option to automatically pay the full statement balance, unlike Amex, Chase, or even basic credit unions.

It feels like a trap, and for that reason, I can’t rely on this card and app for everyday use or recommend it... no.",2025-05-10,5

""Less light is needed"", ""More light is needed"", ""Move closer"", ""Move back"" over and over and never lets you deposit the damn check. Getting worse.

I spent three hours setting up ACH transfers because the prompts are counterintuitive.",2025-03-28,5
Terrible. I ordered the Alaska miles credit card and set up through B of A app I messed around with it for about 45 minutes and couldn't figure out how to even add my bank account to pay the credit card fee. I ended canceling the credit card shortly after because the app was too frustrating. Shame bc i would have liked to have that card. I'm in my 40s and moderately tech savvy and use 10ish online banking and finance apps. This is by far the worst. not intuitive nor user friendly,2025-04-18,5
"This app is very glitchy. When I try to change between accounts it logs you out. You log in again, click to switch accounts, logs you out. Do it 5 more times and finally you're in. Some days you could click it for an hour and it will log you out every time. Sometimes it works on the first try like it's an actual functioning app. But most days after about 3 attempts I walk away from banking today and try again tomorrow. If there were an alternative app, I would most definitely scratch this one!",2025-03-16,5
"this is the most complicated bank application I have ever used. any time task, like making a payment, setting up auto pay, adding a new bank account to pay you credit card with, EVERYTHING requires an extensive amount of time trying to figure out where and how to do it. careful, they won't let you pay your credit card with a new bank account until they send small deposits to your account to ""Verify"" which takes 3 days. this is to make you late on your payment, don't be fooled. worst bank",2025-05-14,5
"By far the WORST banking app I've used (out of the 9 I use on a regular basis). Set up paperless billing from the get-go, but then never received a statement, and couldn't set up a payment account via the mobile app (had to be in a web browser). Just discovered you can't even make a custom payment amount through the mobile app - only the statement balance or the minimum amount due. What a joke! Why even have a mobile app???",2025-05-14,5
"Since last update, the app does not perform well. It keeps crashing. It becam e very slow. It is now a year later since my review above. The slow condition has not changed. It might even be a somewhat slower. I use the app several times per day. It is imposible to make Zelle payments. It just keeps frozen after the option for Zelle is selected.",2025-03-22,5
I have no idea how this terrible app has 4 stars. Can't send yourself an email confirming a balance payment. The payment record doesn't show up for up to two days. So you can't tell if it's already paid or not. I frequently find myself overpaying because of this basic stuff that is just non-existent.,2025-04-04,5
"Horrible user interface, not easy to navigate through statements or set up auto pay to a credit card, whoever designed the app needs to fired. Update: nothing has changed, still the worst banking app in existence. tried to pay the bill and it defaulted back to the home screen. no confirmation, nothing. really horrible",2025-03-22,5
it's not just the app it's the bank itself too. regarding the app you can only view your FICO score but you cannot get anything else like reports about new accounts dark web searching if for seeing if your information or security was compromised. Don't be misled by their interest rate which is almost zero it's 0.01 which means 100th of 1% not 1%. they do have a good mobile check deposit option.,2025-05-01,5
"Seems after a recent update, the app now crashes and restarts going back to login when taking a photo of a check for a deposit. Does it consistently, have rebooted phone, app is updated. Have to resort to using the app on my *gasp* ipad to do the same. Otherwise, I have no problems with the app. Samsung Galaxy S24FE, TMobile, Android 14, OneUI 6.1. Otherwise I have no problem with the app, does what a banking app should do. Unfortunately I need it for depositing checks more than anything.",2025-03-20,5
I love the app prior to the changes both on website and here. it was much more user friendly. Now you have to use two screens and when you make a payment it never puts you back to the location you made payment from it puts you back to the top and then you have to scroll all the way back down to the bottom. it is not user friendly at all. It also makes it difficult to transfer from one Bank of America to My accounts at other Banks suck as saving and checking account.,2025-02-19,5
"I have never used such an awful mobile app for banking. You can't set up a custom value for monthly auto-pay (likely intentional), setting up credit payments is extremely odd and could only be done through the website page, and the general interface looks like it's been programmed by a government lackey. Feels like an app from 2012. Never banking with y'all after I pay off this promotional card. I may just pay it off tomorrow so I don't have to deal with the poorly designed user interface.",2025-02-06,5
"Is it me or does it seem odd when an app offers a feature but said features aren't working properly or have stopped working altogether. I'm referring to the My Balance and the App Deposit features. There was a time when I used both of these all the time but overtime, the My Balance feature no longer works for me and the App Deposit stops working after I snap a picture of the 2nd side. God forbid you try contacting support, you HAVE to go ERICA first, and she's limited at best. Oh well.",2025-01-24,5
"Is there a single UX designer who reviewed this app before it was released? My god there is so much JUNK. I simply want to see my credit balance, my transactions, and my rewards balance. I have to click through so many different menus and statements, etc. to just see my recent purchases. All while being distracted by whatever BS BoA is trying to push to get more money from us. This app needs to be streamlined, bigtime. It makes me want to cancel my card.",2025-01-23,5
What a disaster this app is. Information and actions scattered all over in unrelated groups of menus. Tons of junk items all over the screens. Cant tell where you are expected to click on as sometimes its the whole framed section and sometimes only on text that isnt highlighted. And 75% of time you try to change something and it wont change and just says it cant do that right now and to try again later. I've had to have reps by phone reset my account options because the app wont let me.,2025-02-12,5
After finally figuring out the 4 steps to go to in order to pay my credit cards they went & changed the app again. Now they're called transfers instead of payments & works exactly like a transfer. I can no longer put a NOTE for what I'm paying so can't keep track or organized. Have to go online to add transfer between accounts memo. The neat features it had to distinguish from the website are gone so no point in using it. This app has been destroyed over last 2 years so 10/10 I do NOT recommend.,2024-12-19,5
"The app is limited with the available settings. I tried to stop the monthly balance transfer offers by mail but there is no way to stop them (The paperless option is already enabled) and calling customer service is a joke (45 mins wait) and then when the rep finally answered , I noticed there was 1 to 2 seconds voice lag and she didn't quite understand the issue so had to transfer me to another department who automatically hang up on me... Terrible Service!",2025-01-08,5
"I hate this app. Signing up was difficult, none of my points for Alaska Airlines are showing up. It shouldn't take 2 months for points to show up when I can take a miles for opinions survey for American Airlines and they show up the next day. It should also show a 0 balance when I make a payment. I was billed twice this month because I thought it didn't go through when I looked at it the day after I paid it.",2025-01-29,5
"The most difficult app to use, it is extremely difficult to pay on an account.

"if you have multiple credit cards through them, the app will not allow you to make new payments, even if you already have your bank info stored.

Save yourself the trouble and go with any other credit card provider or bank altogether.",2025-03-21,5

I'm not blind, I know the amount I put in!",2024-02-07,5
New version is awful & inconvenient. All of my alert settings are gone. The functionality your credit card bill - 90% of the reason I even use the app - is confusing! The set up makes it look like you're paying from your credit card rather than paying your balance. It doesn't show your minimum payment or due date when setting up the payment bc it's on a different page. Other banks' apps are so much better - more modern and seamless! 👎🏼,2024-06-05,5
"One step away from actually go to the bank. While you can check your balance and transfer, if you have to deposit a check, you have to close all other apps on your phone, even the alarms.

Latest update makes navigation more difficult. I used to be able to access bill pay from the first screen now it is buried 3 layers deep and requires clicking a menu that pops up.

It isn't this difficult with other CC companies. Also, Erica is unnecessary garbage. Stop it.",2024-03-04,5

This app is very hard to navigate. it feels like you have to jump through so many non-essential hoops just to make a payment.

"I find this app quite unintuitive. And the fact that I can't set up an auto pay from any place other than a Bank America checking account while I'm on the app is quite stupid. It will allow me to make a payment from my other bank account, but not to set up an auto-pay. I learned that if you go to the website you can actually set it up from another bank. However even then I had a horrible experience with the people there not even being able to tell if I had an auto pay set up.",2025-01-18,5
The app is full of bugs. It gets on verification loops asking for activation/text verification/ password input at least two or three times. Options to manage credit cards are difficult to find and they are located in different parts of the app instead of having everything related to the card in one place. Options like changing the due date should be on the app instead of having to reach out to customer service for it. You should copy what Chase do with their app and Amex online customer service.,2025-03-11,5
"Way too much emphasis on trying to upsell services while actual service is poor. Cant easily see all transactions anymore, pending payments, pending disputes...and to get a hold of a service rep sends you on a wild goose chase around the country, and 1/2 hour hold time each, only to be transferred to a different department. The service and app never used to be this bad.",2025-02-04,5
"I find it ridiculous how you still can't set up notifications for ANY debit card transaction. It has to be a minimum of $50 or $100. An institution this big and the fees they charge should at least have an option that's so simple, but very useful. It's been over decade and the features of this app are virtually the same, yet it gets even harder to access your account over the phone. Ridiculous",2025-01-11,5

This happens every time I try to log in now! I have to reboot my phone(sometimes more than once) just to be able to log into the App! This started about 2 weeks ago.

Please fix your guys app this has been going on for months. It's not my phone it's not my number it's your app.",2025-03-24,5
Please allow an option to lock and unlock credit cards directly from the App. The peace of mind and confidence to use your services will be exponential. Thank you. Update:Although the option to lock the card was added. Great! It is by far the most tideous one of all my cards to use. I now have to call to get an authorization code to be able to unlock the card instead receiving an email or txt. The wait times are often horrendous and inconvenient when trying to purchase something. Please fix.,2024-12-30,5
"Firstly forget about speaking to someone if you have an issue with login issues, basic customer support about credit card questions. Also i have never had any issues with all of the other banking apps or regular websites. Specifically setting up (Auto payment) for your monthly statements.

This app gets the most basic banking functions done, but it is annoying and downloads statements to a secret bunker in the middle of nowhere, where no one can find them.",2024-07-26,5
"Useful when it works and has some good features. But over the past year half the time I try to use it, it doesn't let me either view my accounts or make transfers/pay bills when I want to (which is the entire damn point of the app). Instead I get a pop-up that ""some accounts may be temporarily unavailable"" but it's become a 50/50 chance for this issue to happen. Even when it starts out fine, within 10-30 mins it brain farts and suddenly I can't do anything in it even when I log out and back in.",2024-10-02,5
"3 times while using Bill Pay, the just closed. I immediately logged back into the app to confirm payment was still set up. But each time, unfortunately, I only checked one of the payments.

Thanks B of A. 😞",2024-08-19,5
"It is infuriating how many clicks this app requires to pay bills. Each time you want to pay a couple bills, it takes minimum 4 clicks just to get to the screen to pay someone, and then you can only pay one at a time, and after you pay, it is another 4 clicks to pay the next bill. It is also a big let down that you can't reconcile receipts thru the app. The app used to be a lot better, they need to evaluate their user interface for ease of use, or people will stop using it.",2024-08-29,5
"I have been with BOA for a LONG time, and their app, along with their banking security has steadily declined over the last few years. I cannot even navigate their bill pay on the app any longer. If they believe they are making things easier for those, like myself, who are not tech savvy, they are WRONG. Additionally, they have sent out the same checks several times, through bill pay, draining my account. Calling a rep proved to be futile because the person helping me was incompetent.

I'm frustrated with this app. I used to have a mortgage and a credit card about 20 years ago with BofA. Both were closed. Recently got a new card. The app shows my the new info but when I go to pay the card it shows the old card that's been cancelled for years now. Also had to call to remove old email addresses twice. Still has an old one listed but at least the new one is the primary now. I just don't find the app to be user friendly. I can't pay my credit card from it.,2024-11-08,5

Bill payment from an account other than BoA is impossible to set up in the app. The payment and transfer menu has not been updated in multiple years and takes multiple steps to get done.

Lowered rating 1 for change 2 for no reply.",2024-09-11,5
"The biometric login is woefully unreliable. And when I try to use the password, if I accidentally hit a wrong key, I only have a second to notice my mistake. It can lock me out until I set up a new password. (I no longer have steady hands). The way other web sites work, when typing in a password, there is an ""eye"" icon to the right we can click on that allows us to see the completed password in case we typed any letters incorrectly. I wish you would use that system.",2024-09-28,5
"As a whole, the app works fine, but there are some annoyances. In the past, bill pay process would occasionally switch up, where sometimes you can simply select the balance you wish to pay while other times you must enter the value manually. As of now, it appears resolved. The latest issue I've experienced is inconsistent card usage notifications. I have them turned on if my card is charged online (without card present), but it does not work all the time. It seems to depend on vendor.",2025-05-05,5
"I can get done what I need to do. I use my laptop for financial transactions more than the phone app. One regular frustration is that the log in process does not permit the user to show the password as it is being entered. Password entry errors are common for my old thumbs. If I could show the password, I could easily correct errors and log in on first attempt. As of 4/27/25, the app still has the deficiency described in the previous paragraph. So, the laptop app is far superior.",2025-04-27,5
"update may 21st 2025 the developer continues making the app less intuitive, and now they are using it as a marketing tool. I'm actively looking for an alternative. ---- It's not as intuitive as it used to be... but still, it is convenient. The app is quite stable on the Samsung phones I have. I have never crashed in more than 15 years.",2025-05-21,5
"this would be a 5 star app, but I consistently find it cumbersome and difficult to view recent transactions on my accounts. I have other accounts with other banks and this is not so difficult on their apps. their apps are much easier to navigate and more... transparent. All of my activity for an account could be visible on a single page. I should not have to hunt for it, download and combine reports. BoA is not a bad bank, but their app erodes trust in my opinion.",2025-05-08,5
"This app has some good features. However, the increase and the persistence of in-app advertisements are becoming annoying. Take, for example, the yearly ""reward recap video"". It appears at the end of a calendar year and stays there for months, even if you watch or dismiss it. It is on the dashboard and in the insights. Of course, it is not merely a reward recap but also ads for other products. Zelle and some kind of insurance are other examples but those wind down quicker.",2025-04-09,5
"I don't know if this is an app glitch or a BOA issue, but you can't setup autopay for a fixed amount on any BOA credit cards, even with the e-bill. If it is a BOA issue, that's messed up because it seems like you want us to forget to pay so you can collect fees. If it's an app issue, please fix...I don't see why we can't do autopay like we do for other bills.",2025-04-10,5
Good overall but making payments for credit cards should be possible to make by tapping on the credit card in question. Autopay is much harder to set up than other major banking apps. Sometimes long wait times for support. Good fee waiving and more granular options than most other apps.,2025-05-19,5
"The app works well, easy to use, very functional. Banking with BOA for over 25 years.

"Very useful app, makes it completely unnecessary to go to the bank unless you need to withdraw or deposit cash. Would be really useful to have the remaining statement balance for credit cards somewhere; it only lists the full statement balance and the current balance. Accepting deals is a slow and tedious process, stop wasting my time by doing a pop up page that blocks me from. activating more offers.",2025-03-29,5
"Making payments, especially recurring payments and payments to BoA accounts is horribly convoluted. It used to be fine. Now it's just annoying to find current recurring payments and activity in the app. I still am not sure how my BoA credit card payments are managed and how to view them, but at least they're happening. I think it's because payments and transfers are separate, I guess? Everything should be in the payments section. I don't care how it works in the background, make it simple again.",2025-01-20,5
"I don't like that when you make a payment. It doesn't show up on your account for a long time. My other credit cards send me an email immediately, and it shows in my transactions that I made a payment. So the problem is if it errors in the middle of a payment I can't tell if it went through or not because it doesn't show on my account immediately. I might not get an email about it until it's already past due. It took 4 days to post payment after I initiated it.",2025-02-04,5

I literally have to force stop it like 3 times for it to work properly and it gets annoying. I stopped using for payments because it's not working properly at all.",2025-01-27,5
"This app is very confusing or maybe it's me I don't know, but anytime I want to find any transactions I don't care if it's a week to a month ago I cant find nothing in the app, and I know I've used it. I would love for it to be just like a banks mobile app where it shows the balance, payment due, how much and list any or all transactions listed below including payments, but I'm sure all those click here, click there screens couldn't be condensed.",2024-09-16,5
"Automatic Notification of Card Usage would be a great tool. Also, being able to see transactions as they process, from pending to paid, in the app would be very helpful for managing all bill payments.

If these were on the menu the app would be worth having on my phone and more efficient for customers. Thank you for listening.",2024-02-16,5

We have successfully used this feature Many times in the past, but it does Not appear to be working at this time.

"This app has been one that I have used more often than any other app. We have several accounts with BOA, including credit card accounts. The automatic payments setup has been difficult and hard to follow up on to be sure payments have been made on time.

I set up the same external account several times because it disappeared either from the mobile App or the PC website or both.",2024-09-24,5
"It's good, does the job, maybe could make it a little easier to schedule transfers but it does the job. The notifications don't work correctly, you can turn off certain options but still get notifications on the app. The text message alert about a direct deposit being put into your account does not work correctly on Android, I never had an issue before until an update maybe a year or so ago and have not gotten a text message notification about direct deposit",2024-03-03,5

Annoying.",2024-02-04,5
"Been a BOA customer for 25yrs and using online banking since its start. The last 5yrs or so, there's really been a lack of innovation in the app and it's taken a step back. Examples: It used to take literally 2 clicks to pay my CC bill. Nowadays it takes many more. Simple things like picking the source of funds to pay with are not defaulted in. The payment amount used to default to the CC balance, but now I have to type it in. These small things save time and reduce errors but are long gone.",2024-01-14,5
"Always had great experience with BOA. They really watch out for you when it alerting someone of unusual activity. Update: I had to remove two stars for bounce fees and closing an account because of overdue BOUNCE FEES. One of my accts was negative due to the bounce fees that were added because of Netflix and Google trying to take there mesely 12.00 and 1.99 when I lost my job. They allowed them to keep trying to get their money and, every time, added another bounce fee then closed my account.",2024-08-08,5

"Normally I am very pleased with the BofA app but more recently I have been having problems with it. It freezes or stops working properly. Often, bill pay can't be use or other information is unavailable and I have exit and return later to complete what I wanted to do. That is very inconvenient and annoying. When the system works, it's great but when it freezes as it has been doing, then not so great.",2024-09-20,5

However, it's not intuitive, you have to dig at times to find things, and I can't turn off features I don't want to see/use, such as Erica (acct insights feature). I don't want your extra services, I don't want to be shown what you deem important or the monthly product. So, quit unnecessary advertising/pushing of ""services"" I don't want. Want to be useful? Make the app intuitive. Sounds simple, right?",2024-11-20,5
"Great app for banking, been using it since I became a BoA member in 2021. This past year, it has been crashing the first time I try signing in, requiring me to sign in twice before the app stays open for me to check my account. It's a sleek app, but does get frustrating having to sign in twice each time I want to look at my account.",2024-01-18,5
I wish the app would reflect the new balance immediately after you make a credit card payment like the Citi card app does. This would eliminate a lot of confusion. I just double paid my bank of America credit card balance because I wasn't sure if it recognized that I made the initial payment. Now I'll have to contact the them and get it all straightened out in the morning 😠.,2024-10-22,5

Is there an update or something i can do? Please!!! Thank you!",2024-08-01,5
"Used to be better. I only had to select a single option to pay off a credit card in the statements page from my checking account. They now make you jump through an ever more increasing number of hoops to do it. You now have to go to Pay & Transfer > Pay Bills > Add Payee > Add a Company, and then put in the credit account number and full amount to pay (you'll have to remember from memory or else it erases). This can eventually lead to some people being late in their credit card payments.",2024-03-11,5
"I have been with BOA for many years. It's my primary bank. My question is, why doesn't this app allow a customer to set up automatic payments without having to use a desktop computer. Even contacting a BOA rep on the phone is of no help. All other credit cards I have with other institutions have offered this option for years. It's not rocket science!! BOA is simply behind the times by not offering this option on its mobile app. Maybe it's about time to get with the program. I do!",2024-05-14,5
"Great app. Makes my banking really easy and convenient. No unnecessary protocols. However, a recent update removed my access to my Fico score, which used to feature under the life plan section.

I think this should be looked into. Thanks.",2024-01-06,5

So I set it to pay, and it said I already was scheduled for the same amount so I cancelled. Searched everywhere on app and nothing about a scheduled payment. Repeated then backed out. Is there a way to see a scheduled payment if there is one?? I need to know. It should be available information.",2024-12-10,5

B/se of this, I've received a number of notifications for ""available balance below the minimum""! I hope you can fix it! Again and again, the issue of not showing the real-time actual balance has caused me to get my account balance below minimum. I'm not sure if there's any penalties for such mishaps. However, the app has to fix this problem.",2024-01-10,5
"Far ahead of other banks' apps that I've used. Everything works really well. UPDATE 2/1/2024 The format change just made in the app is a few steps backward. The order of the list of my accounts is now changed and is very inconvenient. I need to be able to rearrange the list. I can't believe that's not possible on the account page. Also, the font displaying the accounts and balances is much smaller than previously. It's less esthetically pleasing and less useful.",2024-02-01,5
"There are too many steps just to complete simple tasks. The changes made were unnecessary and troublesome. Not happy with the changes.

Then tap on password then the whole thing comes up when I tap on it it doesn't go in so I type the first two letters of my password and then delete it and then it automatically goes in and I can log in. Every time, that's what I got to do. And have no idea how I figured out how to do it... It's ridiculous. I have like 10 credit cards in like eight apps. This is the only one who does it.

Also, when I received a large sum of money to my account, there was a check for 50k that cleared on my end, but the recipient never got it.

"The app will stay open in the background even after closing the app, opening the recent app list, and swiping it away. If I open the recent list again, there it is. Why do I have to swipe it away twice? And you can't find answers online. Anytime you mention ""bank app"" and ""closing"" the Internet loses its mind and every single link that pops up is about closing down your account at the bank. The only one that mentions an app asks if you can close your account through the app. Where are answers?",2024-05-12,5
Taking it down a star or two as the app seems to digress with each update. Notable degradations include worse check-deposit imaging/reliability and deteriorated navigation/site architecture making it more difficult to find and execute tasks like Start ATM withdrawal.

"It was easier to use prior to the last update. don't like how it ""makes mistakes ""and pays accounts from the savings instead of checking!apps! don't like it automatically pulling money from savings and deposits it in checking even when I still have money in checking butt I get the ""low balance "" thing so it transfers. if there's a positive balance there isent a low balance!!!",2025-04-08,5
"If it had an ATM function it would be perfect. I find it easy to use from clear icons and menus. If BOA is smart, they will not alter this to "" make it easier"" anytime in the foreseeable future. 01/24 update. The features that employ their bot or AI functionality are lacking. The machine learning of the AI function really needs to be worked on as typical it doesn't understand a person. For instance when asking for a phone number it referreds back to the ask me a question page.",2024-01-12,5
"I love being able to do so many banking things from my phone. However, I've noticed that recently I can no longer see the ""scheduled payments"" on some bills that I have set to go out. For example, I just set my cell bill to go out at the end of the month. It usually will show up on the list saying, ""scheduled on June 30."" But instead, it went back to saying, ""paid on May 30."" It is WAY too easy to duplicate payments when it doesn't show the newest payment.",2024-06-10,5
"In the last couple months, the app exits immediately after I put in a username and password. This happens regularly now, unclear why. It never used to do this. I've changed phones and the same thing happens on the new phone. My credentials are correct, because if I reopen the app and reenter them, it logs me in correctly. Maybe it has to do with how the app exits due to inactivity, and something isn't cleared for the next login.",2024-01-28,5
"I have been a client for years!!!! Using the app since day one, and all of a sudden, every time I'm making zelle transactions, I get an annoying bubble message saying ""Bank of America isn't responding,"" with a very high chance of the app closing, and a simple transaction becomes a nightmare. It's been months, and I have Uninstaller the app several times, but it doesn't work.",2024-02-01,5
"The app is great except for one thing. Every time I try to close it from inside the app, it opens right back up like nothing happened. The only way I got it to close is I went backto the home screen, then the app viewer, then I could close it. But it wasn't always like this. So good app, but needs to be re-optimzed.",2024-03-20,5
"Easy to use and extremely convenient. You can do everything from checking account balances, transfer money around, chat via the app with AI support, place disputes and stop payments, and more. You can also use it for multiple accounts and log in and out between two or more using the one app. If you have a BOA account, you NEED this app!",2024-05-26,5
"While it works, and by that I mean I can see my accounts, all 2.... I prefer the layout of the last version, especially in account details, before it listed all your transactions, pending first then cleared.... now it only shows 2 with extra, unneeded, info untill you select that you want to ""see all"". Edit 11/6/24: View check image is broken, at least for me, just resets the app and makes me login again.",2024-11-06,5
"If a user taps Deposit Check, it would be more efficient if the ""Front of the Check"" element opened automatically instead of user having to tap it to open. 2nd Rec. While using the B of A online on a computer, the user has to request an OTP code on their phone. Once the code arrives on their phone, the user has to drag the cursor into the 1st square on the PC to enter the code. Would be better if, once the user has requested the OTP code that the cursor auto goes to the square. Amazon does it!",2024-01-27,5
"My only complaint is that you don't allow customers to see their passwords as they are put in, and sometimes you have to repeat the input because it was entered wrong by mistake. If you could see the letters as we enter them the way it normally works with passwords, it would be much more efficient. Thank you",2024-04-03,5
"So far so good with the app, it works easy most of the time, but also time to time it shut down while your using it. Also I like it just a few clicks your there on what you looking for. I just wish they also have the section that you could see end of your low promotional balance, than trying to remember or check your statement from last year for it. One of my other bank has section like that, so you could be on top of your dues, beforehand.",2024-08-10,5
"Only issue is mobile deposit has been a pain. It is constantly, use darker background, too close, too far, and then when it does capture picture it looks like a elongated, distorted check or might capture front correct then, back image does that and vise versa. Have to close app, log back in and keep trying.",2024-03-19,5
"Could still be clearer, where you're navigating, but it's unlikely you'll end up in the completely wrong area. (Something simple to implement could be a link from ""bills paid"" to ""pay this payee again"" area. I often find myself in a receipts area when I just need to pay bills; that's what I use the app for almost exclusively) Anyway, if you're willing to give in and talk to the customer service AI or faceless customer service person it's mostly alright. Accept the future.",2024-04-30,5
Right now the app is working perfectly and the alerts on use are being delivered. It was surprising that it took a week after set up for the alerts to start happening. It made me wonder if I had done it incorrectly. A note saying it takes up to 7 days for the app to start reporting would have been comforting.,2024-04-26,5
"its convenient for quick things but its not as informative as I'd like. No history, not much transfer options. Two years after I can use my phone for access code and the inbox history is now fixed. I love that I can see my balance after each transaction. True banking on hand!👌🏾",2024-02-08,5
"Pretty seemless. Have had a few glitches in the past, but fixed rather quickly. Overall, its a much better app that city credit union. Has features like card lock, mobile deposits, immediate money transfers and zelles, transactions searches, clear and visibile font, update information or order new card right through the app, and you can file a dispute through the app.",2024-09-29,5
"Many of the latest updates help make the app easier to navigate which is great. But I have noticed a delay in postings. I check the account to check to make sure I made a payment but nothing shows. So I make another payment, check a day later and now both payments show and went thru!",2024-02-08,5
"Update 5/2024 : Same as previous post. It's still not easy to view transactions. Review 7/2023: Works quickly and efficiently, transferring funds into different accounts. Also, I would like to see a better transaction view than changing the date and saving it. It would be useful to have a continuous scrolling of transactions and not have to adjust each month. Otherwise, it's a great app.",2024-05-06,5
"I really like using the app, it makes seeing my balances and paying cr. cards easily by transferring payments. I can arrange my accounts on one page for easy access. See my statements and print out a copy. Also I can access Zelle and send money. However 2 things I am not happy about, 1. I can't see my sent Zelle history when I open Zelle from the app. And 2. Erica's problems understanding many questions I ask to to access information I need to see. This is not helpful & I have to call.",2024-11-12,5
"The app is good, but I wish you would put back the option to see your whole password when typing it. That helps people with disabilities to know they have typed it in correctly. Now I must type very slowly and still can't be sure if I've gotten it right. I've had to change my password many times because the app does not allow repeated mistakes. It's been very frustrating. Please put the option back on.",2024-08-04,5
"Was it only a glitch or did they restore the functions that were missing after the latest update? (3/23/24 - The revised Bill Pay user interface is lousy. Much harder to navigate and the best part of the calendar view (total outgoing per day) has been removed! Change it back, like you did the last time you messed with this.) As of 3/26/24 the bill pay UI is back to normal.",2024-03-26,5
Great app! BOA constantly innovating to improve performance. Negative change: Do not like the format of cash back deals program any longer - too difficult to access or claim deal; also icon text of deals too small when viewing in selection screen (have to click on most icons to even view what company the deal is for).,2024-02-17,5
"Keep track and balances Easier to maintain budget. It is easier to manage debit card transactions and credit card transactions. The mobile app is available 24/7, almost anywhere and anytime, except during account maintenance processing for a few minutes. Another 2 years has gone by, and this app keeps me secure. I make an update to my budget anytime 24 hours a day. I have never had a failure.",2025-01-26,5
"I recently got scammed online and my Bank of America app caught it, before I did and locked my card so they could do no further damage. It's been hard catching up, but it could have been much worse. Thank you! Great app all around. I appreciate the alerts. Everything works smoothly. Very handy, particularly for those of us who live in rural areas.",2025-02-06,5
ok. I admit it. I was wrong about the BoA app. I have been using it for several months now to check my account and to process payments. I haven't tried using the check deposit part. I use my phone to check my account and to issue payment when I receive an email with an invoice to pay rather than the BoA web portal. The one feature I would love to have is a panel showing me the total of remaining payments scheduled for the rest of the current month.,2025-05-17,5
"I like this app. I can check my account without a computer. I have paid bills, transferred money ,made a deposit. I know what is happening at all times.I can follow my spending track and view my credit score. Have not had any problems. I appreciate getting a heads up for charges to my credit card. Still very happy with this app and with Bank of America for all the assistance with any problems I have. Again thanks",2025-04-15,5
"This app is still very easy to navigate and guides one through all of the much needed basic features that's needed, i.e., your spending habits, clear explanation of all your transactions. UPDATE: Bank of America has continued to provide exceptional service in my experience, which matches the app description well above and beyond. I'm especially impressed with the ""Ask Erica"" feature, which acts as a personal guide. I'm a long-time customer and find that this app just continues to get better.",2025-04-05,5
"Best app amongst all other bank apps,user friendly, only advice I have is to describe a transaction clearly, some transactions are called a name then after posting the name changes, this causes confusion and many times we thought it was a fraud transaction, example if it's a counter deposit don't called it a check please and many more examples just like this.",2025-05-15,5
1. Log out should be more prominent. Currently it's gray on white and barely noticeable. Used to be red 2. I like bill pay better when I can see my pay-to and scheduled payments on the same page. As it is now I have to jump back and forth between the two. Not very efficient. 3. Getting better at this new app. Now pass the learning curve and can appreciate the changes. I would like to be able to do a print screen or download of specific information I have queried.,2025-03-13,5
"This app answers almost all of the questions I could ask, plus it is always there for me at odd times when the bank is totally unavailable at night, weekends, on trips, holidays, etc. Even when I forget a detail that I just looked at and inconveniently forgot, I am able to simply log back in and obtain the info I need without hesitancy or headache! Thank you, BOA!",2025-03-21,5
"No computer needed, do everything on your phone. Instantly check and pay my credit cards, monitor my account activity, deposit checks just by taking a picture of them, great app I use it every day. ( Update ) I still use this app almost everyday and I love it. I forgot to mention about the time you save using this app, it's like you don't have to go to the bank anymore.",2025-04-15,5
"Improved! Had to re-download due to a continuing issue (months). After doing this, the app goes round and round constantly stuck in a loop, asking for a new password over and over!! Sucks. The my balance glitch is STILL an issue.. States it's been over 30 days since you logged in, Wrong!! 🤬 Issues seem to be gone! Now the app is greatly improved. 👍",2025-04-03,5
"Is easy to use and sign in, as long as I remember my password . It is easier to log in with Biometric or fingerprint. I'm so glad I got the app. I had a charge that I wasn't sure of, and the app alerted me of too many attempts to get paid. Is easy to communicate with B of A card services, and they handled the transaction without any problems. I highly recommend this app. It's Aug 19th 2024 & I'm still liking this app. Even when I forget my password, it's easy to get a secure connection. Love it",2025-04-03,5
"My experiences with Bank of America have always been excellent. My review in 2022 has not changed! I love my bank. They have caught frauds quickly and charges that seemed suspicious! This is all very important to me. Their overall business with me, with their different alerts that you can program , make banking with Bank of America an enjoyable experience. The BOA App is excellent! It is the only thing I use when I am on the internet. It makes banking so much easier! 3/2025 I still feel the same",2025-03-11,5
"I continue to believe this banking app is outstanding. Some new changes have been added which improve the users ability to effectively use this banking app. in the past, I have been frustrated by labels & descriptions not being intuitive or leaving me unable to do what's necessary. This has been greatly improved & I can do everything I need.",2025-03-31,5
"I had a bad experience at first where they wouldn't let me make payments. Turns out i put in the info for my savings account, not checking. So that was the problem. No i have none and i really like the card, the app, and the company. They always have pretty good deals to save money. I must have 20+ credit cards. This one is one of my faves.",2025-03-03,5
"The Erica icon gets in the way, wish I could turn it off and on, as I like. Came back to share that Erica had been move, adjusted my stars from 4 to 5. I've been with BOfA for more than 15 years, probably 20 and the bank has changed to be better, and so has their app. I don't remember last time I went into a physical bank. The access tonso much online and in the app saves alot of time. My app helps keeps me on track and the deals are pretty good. Keeping it updated is important.",2025-03-03,5
"The app's user interface is clean and intuitive. Checking my account balances, transferring funds, and paying bills are all seamless. I also like the real-time notifications that help me stay on top of my spending and any account activity. Another standout feature is the Zelle integration for quick and easy money transfers. It’s fast and reliable, saving me so much time. Overall, the Bank of America app has made banking more convenient and stress-free for me. Highly recommend!",2025-01-01,5
"""I've been a customer of Bank of America for over 20 years, and my experience has been excellent.

Highly recommend for anyone looking for reliable banking",2025-01-05,5
"This app is so easy to navigate. The notifications of usage keep you up to a minute of account activity. I love that. Plus, the free FICO score notifications are also helpful to keep you aware. Depositing a check by taking a picture and transferring money to outside accounts or people keeps the visits to the bank at a minimum.",2025-03-02,5
"Always available, and always accurate. The app makes it easy to access my accounts and do whatever I need to do. I have, on occasion, had purchases show up in my account that were not mine. Bank of America caught the fraud before it was available for me to see online, and a representative contacted me to check the purchase. I think that is the best reason to keep my account with them.",2025-01-06,5
"I have found this app to be invaluable. Thank you, BOA, especially for your customer service! I notice Google is injecting popups to take my data, which is concerning. Anybody who wants to OFFER their data to Google, more power to them. But coming in my bank app with a ""We know what you personal info is and want to retain it"" is outside boundaries, in my opinion.",2025-02-27,5
"Good app. Intuitive. Would prefer FEWER pop-up windows with other offer information while I'm trying to accomplish a transaction. Otherwise, great. Same PROBLEM to fix - you HAVE to stop the annoying pop-up!!! You can not see what you are doing. Stop the gratuitous promotion of your other financial products in the banking application that I THOUGHT WAS MADE FOR CUSTOMER CONVENIENCE.",2025-05-19,5
"Works as intended. Most of the critiques are about credit card issues. Their credit company is separate and it will merk you financially if complicated problem comes up. I no longer have a boa cc. The bank itself had always corrected problems, prevented fraud and made multiple accounts easy to use. Customer since 1986. Navigating the app is not as intuitive as want, but I can find ilservice needed with a search.",2025-02-20,5
The app is easy to use. Has awesome security features. It's been the best banking experience we've had and have banked here for nearly 20 years. Erica is good to take you different places in the app but I don't find her helpful for much else. Maybe that was her intended purpose. I also am often confused that the online banking doesn't follow logical order. But that could just be me. I have no plans to go anywhere else!,2025-01-12,5
"Easy to use. Being able to see all of my transactions for each of my cards makes budgeting and saving a breeze. Also, the customizable spending alerts to my phone help protect my accounts. Resolving fraudulent purchases is a stress-free process with BoA's mobile banking app. Even when calling the bank is necessary, the staff are responsive, calm, and friendly.",2024-11-28,5
"I use this app every day. Ck bal, request/send/receive $ with just a phone # or an email address using ZELLE (no more dealing with long routing/account numbers!) Initiate bill pay (ebills) from your end for statements that carry a different monthly balance so you're not surprised by auto pay from the merchant. Set up OD protection by attaching your savings account so there's never a fee. Transfer $ from one account to another - all with mobile banking. Saves time, money & trips to the bank.",2024-11-30,5
"The Bank of America phone app has been a Godsend. I'm thankful for the convenience and ease of use. I can manage the majority of my banking right from my phone, even depositing or transferring money, pay bills...etc. The list goes on and on! I haven't even scratched the surface. There are many more options and services available to use through the app all in the convenience of my home.",2025-01-16,5
"I loved the mobile app until yesterday when the icon on the home page vanished! When I tried to download the app. a message appeared saying my phone was no longer compatible. I downloaded all updates , no help. I'm accessing banking through the BOA site, but it is no where near what the mobile app. did. I used it everyday and loved what Erica could do. I have no idea what to do, as site says Samsung Gallaxy 8 Notes can run the app..but not for me.",2025-03-03,5
"As of about a month ago, the app no longer sends out alerts (mobile notifications) that I have set up and turned on, such as direct deposit received, online/phone purchases made, new e-bill ready, credit card payment due, etc. It always worked beforehand. I've called customer service twice, and still no fix. Update: the bank of america technical support was great and extremely helpful at handing this issue. They were in constant contact with me to get it working again. So app is great",2024-04-07,5
"8/3/2024 This is very handy. It's easy to navigate, fingerprint login saves time. Calendar is helpful. Making payments is a snap! Really useful. It functions as I expect. I like the fingerprint login, it saves time and energy. this has improved greatly since a 2015 review. There are more useful functions and it's easier to navigate than any other bank app that I've used or currently use. The extra star is deserved. I've been using the photo-deposit for checks. Excellent.",2024-08-03,5
"Great app and excellent features. Improvements I'd like to see is a little more customization in budgeting mainly transaction splitting. For example, cash back in same transaction could be split to the appropriate category in budget. Many other ways a transaction can be split especially when you can buy everything in the same store I'd like to be able to allot the amount to the proper budget category. I don't remember when I originally posted this but I still feel the same. Budget needs more.",2024-05-02,5
"Safe and secure Sometimes, the security steps are annoying mostly when I forget my password or something else... and I badly want to get in ... bcse of the security barriers... But at the end of the day, it gives me inner joy and assurance that my account is safe. Therefore, it will be difficult for someone to break in easily. Thanks to the Bank of America team !!!!!",2024-04-23,5
"This app is very convenient. The features it provides, such as expenditures and transactions made by checks and ATM withdrawals, help manage the account more effectively. Also, it provides total monthly expenditures and copies of checks, and it allows me to transfer funds from one account to another account online, all from home. This is great. Love it!",2024-02-23,5
"I can always see my accounts, transfer money, pay bills, etc. This app has helped me tremendously when it comes to online banking. I've been with bank of America for 12 years now, and I've had chase, but their user interface doesn't seem to be as easy and doesn't have all the same options as this app. It also logs you out to protect your info if you forget to log out. The only problems I've had, is sometimes it kicks me out or shuts down, but 98% of the time, it's been good.",2024-11-10,5
"On my all of my Samsung androids; this app is great. It allows you to do most things you can do on the computer. You can check your balance, deposit checks electronically; great feature.

It's easy to use.",2024-01-04,5
This is a great app. Easy to use. Payment reminders which I find helpful because there are times I miss things. BOFA always has my back so I don't miss any payments. All my account info at my fingertips. Easy to send money to other people and/ or transfer money through Zelle. I've been a user for many years with no issues. Safe and super convenient app!!,2024-10-15,5
I have been using the app for quite some time. It is easy to navigate and allows you to do most of the things without disruption including check deposits etc. Keep up the good work. The recent changes (Jan 24) in the App have improved the interaction with individual accounts. However the recipient search in Zelle is quite slow and needs improvement. Bank app does not allow a customer to initiate any message back to the bank. Overall it is a friendly and useful app.,2024-01-30,5
"I love the app because it allows me to do everything in one place. Paying my bills, grocery shopping, and buying online are all the things that I need to do all from one place, which makes life so much easier. I do realize that I buy things on impulse. But with the security alerts that Bank of America offers, I have time to rethink before actually making a purchase.",2024-11-06,5
"Best bank app around. Easy, fast,well designed app. However the new graphics are terrible like children's line drawing. Go back to the old format it now looks like a pdf. Seems the older format is back and easier to make payments to my Bof A credit. Congrats.....I nearly lowered to a 3 or 4 star. Took a long time...good job.",2024-02-04,5
"I have been with BOA for over 20 years and i have not had any problems with them. This app is very user friendly when needing basic information such knowing the balance, finding a transaction, or using zelle. As with other apps, more complex matters (setting up bill pay) would require using a PC. Other than that, I enjoy the BOA app and I use it faithfully.",2024-11-28,5
"2021: I like the app VERY much for what it WILL do, and use it almost daily, sometimes several times a day. It is intuitive, easy, and responsive. I will like it even better when it is designed to do some other things - additional options (plus easier navigation) on Bill Pay, for example. Overall, a very good app.",2024-08-20,5
"The best app period!!!!! I love everything about Bank of America's app. I guick and easy to send and receive money through zelle. You can deposit a legal check into your account simply by taking a picture of the check. I love the sense of security with the alerts notification by text, email or phone call. This was the first company to give me a secured credit card to help build my credit when I was very young and I been with BOA ever since.",2024-10-16,5
"Really one of my favorite apps. I find it to be extremely effective and useful. One of the features I like most is the two party authentication being automatic and the bioscan enabling you to log in almost effortlessly. And the menus and screens are all easily navigated. I have to stay, I find most convenient the ease with which you are able to authenticate your identity when signing in using the app on your phone.",2024-02-29,5
At this time I don't really use the app because of a financial hardship I am experiencing. But soon I will get my finances in order and will be using it daily. But from my past experiences the app has all the features necessary to give the user a convenient way of keeping his account up to date and organized. I have used appa from all the major banks and this app is comparable or better in some instances. My advice is to continue updating it with the features for efficient banking services .,2024-09-20,5

I have never had a problem, except when I forgot a second large check i had written on the acct that had not cleared yet when I paid a CC in full. Caught the error in time and now I get sent a text when my large CHARGES /checks are processed. I also have automatic transfers of funds set up for three transfers a month, with estimation of spending . Months I don't spend I can easily cancel a transfer,which helped during covid lockdown",2024-02-11,5
"I've always valued the convenience and simplicity of paying my bills and completing 99% of my banking via the BOFA App...with only 1 exception. The App is changed and updated, in my opinion, quite often. I'm not computer challenged nor am I tech savvy. That being said, I just get comfortable with a procedure and before I know it, boom!! Time for an update! Are updates required so frequently? This is not a complaint, but merely an observation. Thanks!",2024-03-22,5
"Great app. 🙌 ❤️ Makes it very easy to do most of your banking needs all right on the mobile app 😀 👏 You can pretty much do EVERYTHING!!

Thanks, Bank of America, for simplifying the process. 🙏",2025-05-17,5
"I like the app and bank, it is dependable. I did have a hard time at first logging in but I realized I had to go to login settings and remember this device and save the device.

"Excellent...I receive information about my account instantly. This was my post over 6 months ago. My opinion has even improved. I am totally satisfied. My opinion of BoA app has not changed. if anything, my opinion has improved due to the security, check & balances used to prevent fraudulent activity.",2025-05-15,5
security is excellent. it could be a little more user-friendly. sometimes it is difficult to find what you want. Excellent bill paying.. tracking transactions.. notifications.,2025-05-10,5
BOA is great in protecting our account. We have had some individuals who have tried to make purchases on our account that we did not authorize and BOA is always on top of things and notifies us immediately of any such transactions. BOA keeps us safe. They always are on top of things and we so appreciate it. Very professional and responsible. We feel safe banking at BOA.,2025-05-17,5

"I love how this app keeps me ""on point"" with the things that I must do. I like that it is in sync with my way of doing things. It makes things, that I consider important, easier to handle. Asking questions is easy, finding out balances is easy, transferring from one account to another is easy, and the app gives information about my upcoming payments, (which is a very good thing for someone my age as some of us older folks tend to have a little trouble remembering). So thank you BOA.",2025-03-21,5

Customer Service quickly resolved a lost debit card situation in one telephone call whilst I was traveling in the United States. Update I was contacted re: Possible fraudulent debit card activity.
