"the last update broke the app. it now immediately crashes up opening it. I've restarted my phone, cleared the apps data and cache and even reinstalled it. nothing works. On a OnePlus 8T. edit: it was definitely the update. after downgrading the app version from 25.6.0 to 25.5.0, the app worked again. edit 2: the app is now forcing me to update to log in, even though the app still won't open after the update. would give 0 stars is possible at this point",2025-05-20,1
Runs extremely slow when logging in,2025-05-19,1

"the app doesn't work, it crashes",2025-05-19,1
problems with logging in and now it doesn't recognize the amount of a check. it's a pretty tight check and this dumb app still gives me problems. Also occasionally rejects checks because it thinks I've already deposited them when I haven't. Needs to be tweaked.,2025-05-18,1
"2025 update : still worst app in existence. --- Honestly awful, I consistently have issues logging in, never have been able to use all the features like zelle, and end up having to reset passwords even when typing them in correct and being locked out of my account consistently. The opposite of convenient. update: still worst banking app ever",2025-05-15,1
Used to be great. Small improvement but it crashes when trying to make bill payments. Account transfer feature is working again.App is basically useless now except for remote deposits,2025-05-15,1

Can no longer see any of my accounts when I am logged in. It has been this way for a few months now.,2025-05-10,1
Citizens bank is horrible. Customer support is horrible. The protocols and the number of hoops to jump through to do a simple thing are ridiculous and possibly offensive to my intelligence. EDIT: Citizens bank might be the absolute worst bank I have ever dealt with. Citizens couldn't even get me a new debit card in 3-5 on time. DO NOT BANK WITH CITIZENS.,2025-05-09,1

This app is horrible. I think a bank should have the money to hire someone to develop a good product. The quality of this app is inexcusable. I gave it one star because I couldn't give it a zero star.,2025-04-29,1
horrible. constantly telling me to update my App but then tells me to get rid of other Apps cause there is no room. Give me a break. You close our local branch then do this to me so I can't deposit my checks for my business.,2025-04-29,1

First off, it's typed by your bank, second the amount is easily read, third all criteria the mobile app asks for are met. It causes many problems because unfortunately I don't live near a Citizens. So I'm going to close my account and go to a bank that's closer because this app is just an inconvenience that causes unneeded stress.",2025-03-17,1

We already know the phone number, thanks but no thanks there.",2025-03-10,1
"If I could give it a worse rating I absolutely would. This is probably the worst app i have ever used in my life. This is a horribly made app. You get locked out for no reason and no one picks up support calls.

"I've had this app for about 8 years. You it's been good up till now I would have gave it five stars. But now at least twice a week it locks profile or account. It forces me to change my password.

"The app constantly tells me my account is ""locked"" for security and I need reset my password or my user id needs to be changed and even after doing so it will generate the same errors.

"App refuses my user name, the desktop version, has no issue with my username. To make it suck even,more there's no way to change your username. I give this app 5 gaslights and a big thumbs down for trying to push a Beta version of the shittiest banking app out there. Maybe get the old thing to at least function, before you harp about a Beta version. No one wants the beta version of an app that is broke off and worthless. Not a good marketing decision, not a good app, just start over",2025-02-26,1
This app was great but once they did the latest update I cannot log in on my android. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling several times and talked to customer service (in Mexico City) after a very lengthy hold time. I was told the issue was on their end with Android phones and would be fixed within a couple hours. It is now a week later and still not fixed. As of November 2023...STILL NOT WORKING ON ANDROIDS!!!

It always glitches. And it forces you to use a code sent to text when it doesn't need to be.,2025-02-19,1
So after careful consideration this app is TRUELY garbage.

Lately I've been getting continuously LOCKED OUT of my account even RIGHT AFTER RESETTING MY PASSWORD.,2025-02-19,1
there are nice people in the bank but they require you to make deposits every month well some people don't have all the money in the world and they can't do that so they said I could just flip money back and forth to savings and checking that is ridiculous I will be getting another bank as soon as possible.,2025-02-17,1
bad bank,2025-02-17,1
It sucks. All it does is load / spin. I can never get on my account. Doesn't matter morning noon or night. This app is horrible. I hate it. Citizen Bank needs to figure this out because it's an inconvenience. Also trying to come up with 500 letters / words is an inconvenience when it doesn't require that much detail to describe the problem. I think they do it so people won't write a review. It's ridiculous. But I will just keep typing to take upspace even if it not about the app. Figure,2025-02-16,1

Always says come back in a bit!,2025-02-08,1
It would be great if the app worked. As it is EVERY single week it is locking my account and making me change the password. Ive had over 18 passwords in the last 2 months.

It often doesn't allow me to sign in on the app. I have to go to my computer to see my balance and other information. There is a serious problem with this app.,2025-01-21,1
The app doesn't work half the time and they closed every branch within 45 miles of me.,2025-01-21,1
This app needs an update cat do half of the s stuff I need to do going online is 100% better,2025-01-18,1
Your app and website absolutely fail most of the time simply because of the login issues I have. I always seem to have to call to get my password fixed and 2 minutes later after hanging up my login info still has errors from your own system failure! Same goes for your website too!,2025-01-17,1
"If I could give this app 0 stars, I would... it's a glorified browser that never works, and quite frankly, it is dangerous to the consumer. If there was an emergency where I needed to transfer or access my money, the hoops they make you jump through are ridiculous when the app decides it doesn't want to work (which is every time). PASSWORD RECOVERY DOES NOT EXIST ON THIS ""APP""",2025-01-17,1

App is AWFUL !!?,2025-01-14,1
Why is your app always broken.,2025-01-13,1
I can't take any action from the app with my account. All I can do is view my account. I have a line of credit and I can't access the line of credit from the account and I also can't pay down the balance either. Honestly I would've chosen a different lender if I knew this would've been the experience,2025-01-13,1
I was illegaly charged by a company after they were supposed to be blocked from processing a payment from me. Then told I was gonna receive a credit which I never received. Was told they would cancel my debit card and issue a new one so I can't be charged again by this company. I was told for the inconvenience they were gonna waive the express shipping fee for the new card. Next day I see a $12 emergency card fee on my account. I record my phone calls so i have him lying saved.,2025-01-03,1
Need updated,2025-01-03,1
"The most annoying app. Any time you need to change pages to look at something you'll have to verify via text, even after it says you won't need to verify again. Every single time, I have to have them text me a code, can't just log in like it says. So it lies and makes you have to call to get some number they tell you won't need every time... But rest assured, you will have to waste your time calling and texting every...single...time. I hate it",2025-01-02,1
Terrible!! Can't get to account if all information is 100% correct on the app..,2025-01-01,1

"Works fine on mobile data, but takes up to 10 minutes to start or log in on wifi Not impressed",2025-01-01,1
Citizens bank does not have their customers back when scammed. I was charged illegaly 2 days into a 7 day free trail. Put a dispute in with screenshots of everything possible to prove I was done wrong. I never got my $15 back. I was charged again $15 from the same company which i have no account with. I canceled my free trial and had no account. Now I'm $30 out and citizens bank has done nothing. I had to file a claim with the better business bureau. I am now closing my account with citizens,2024-12-30,1

App & Bank keep the app in an unbalanced state to continue to over charge overdraft fees to customers. check all negative reviews to confirm this reality! Peace of mind is an illusion they want you to feel assured while they sneak in multiple fees. Notifications are not accurate as well so BEWARE OF CITIZENS BANK & THE WAY THEY CONDUCT BUSINESS! Dissatisfied Customer! On multiple levels,2024-12-12,1
"The worst bank ever exists should be out of business scamming people erroderating their words I was so wrong about the four star review no one should ever and never sign up with them especially when ATMs rob your money like really come on like I wish they are out of business and I was step on toes like saying"" don't sign with them you they will hustle you straight dirt bag move that is low and that messed up the business for banks that make you all look bad and I have a lot of problems years ago",2024-12-10,1

Horrible experience always upgrading,2024-12-03,1
"App stopped working, refuses to let me change my password.",2024-12-02,1
Worst app and bank ever. If I was rich they would be kissing my butt to make sure the app works. Since I'm not they don't care about me. I'm an US citizen living in Europe. It does not work unless I pay for a VPN service to connect. Even then the app is awful. I changed from 2 stars to 1 star. I can't enter my Hungarian account number. I had to bother my 84 year old mother. Every time I sign in. It wants to call the US landline for a code. This is the worst app ever.,2024-11-28,1
"Good job, now I cant use the app at all anymore. You require an update to the app, and dont let me login or use it if I dont update. Here's the issue- I CANT UPDATE IT BECAUSE YOU DECIDED TO STOP ALLOWING ANYBODY ON 8.0 OREO FROM USING IT. I guess I'll just move to a bank that doesnt discriminate based on an OS version. Insane.",2024-11-27,1

Your app sucks Everytime I log in on the app it wants to verify that's it's me which is ok other than it doesn't send text messages and it calls my phone with no ring heard and leaves a voicemail that's 6 seconds long and only says please hang up. It does not allow or offer verification code to be sent thru email like the web site does . I'm getting really tired of calling customer service and having to speak or try to understand someone that doesn't speak English. I'mAbout ready to change banks,2024-11-23,1

Hate this app and bank with a passion. You will rarely have access to your money with the number of times you'll get locked out of your account.its worthless. Overdraft fees are criminal,2024-11-14,1

I tried from 730am-230pm to try an get help w the wire transfer. I did a few a month prior. The site kept telling me try again later..... An I needed and tried to get this done all day. Client service kept saying go to a branch or delete the app an the reinstall it. I did 5 times. Did not work. They said there should be a PIN number they gave you know there is no pin number this is ridiculous I have never in all my life for the 11 years that I have had this account been so dissatisfied.,2024-11-13,1

"This app is awful! It needs work. Transactions should be instant and properly display your amount after subtracting! My payments get stuck for two days on PENDING, and I've had a few times where my balance wasn't calculated right at all, so I was over drafted and charged a fee! When I have $25.00 left, it will lie and tell me I still have over $50.00, which can con me into paying another fee! Fix this! I never had an issue with a bank app before.

"While trying to cash my tax check, they not only held the funds but also chose to freeze my whole account without emailing me, and the only reason I found out was because I called. They said they would send something in the mail explaining why I have not received this yet, but on calling again was notified, they extended the review on my account 2 weeks out. If you like having easy access to your money don't pick citizens",2025-03-06,3

"The app constantly tells me my account is ""locked"" for security and I need reset my password or my user id needs to be changed and even after doing so it will generate the same errors.

"App refuses my user name, the desktop version, has no issue with my username. To make it suck even,more there's no way to change your username. I give this app 5 gaslights and a big thumbs down for trying to push a Beta version of the shittiest banking app out there. Maybe get the old thing to at least function, before you harp about a Beta version. No one wants the beta version of an app that is broke off and worthless. Not a good marketing decision, not a good app, just start over",2025-02-26,3
This app was great but once they did the latest update I cannot log in on my android. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling several times and talked to customer service (in Mexico City) after a very lengthy hold time. I was told the issue was on their end with Android phones and would be fixed within a couple hours. It is now a week later and still not fixed. As of November 2023...STILL NOT WORKING ON ANDROIDS!!! Fixed finally!!! 1/6/2024!!!,2025-02-26,3

So after careful consideration this app is TRUELY garbage.

Lately I've been getting continuously LOCKED OUT of my account even RIGHT AFTER RESETTING MY PASSWORD.,2025-02-19,3
there are nice people in the bank but they require you to make deposits every month well some people don't have all the money in the world and they can't do that so they said I could just flip money back and forth to savings and checking that is ridiculous I will be getting another bank as soon as possible.,2025-02-17,3
bad bank,2025-02-17,3
It sucks. All it does is load / spin. I can never get on my account. Doesn't matter morning noon or night. This app is horrible. I hate it. Citizen Bank needs to figure this out because it's an inconvenience. Also trying to come up with 500 letters / words is an inconvenience when it doesn't require that much detail to describe the problem. I think they do it so people won't write a review. It's ridiculous. But I will just keep typing to take upspace even if it not about the app. Figure,2025-02-16,3
"How on earth this has a 4.8 when the app never works or is having, ""maintenance"" done.",2025-02-15,3

Always says come back in a bit!,2025-02-08,3
It would be great if the app worked. As it is EVERY single week it is locking my account and making me change the password. Ive had over 18 passwords in the last 2 months.

You folks have to do a better job keeping up with transactions. Its literally like you want to give people overdraft fees,2025-02-05,3

"It won't let me enroll, worthless!",2025-01-29,3
I went to log into my account and it tells me that I'm locked out of it. I recently left another bank to come back to citizens and this happens. If they keep this up I'm leaving them and joining another bank. I can't afford this foolishness.,2025-01-29,3
BEWARE! I can't login after creating an account. My account can't be found by the bank's customer support and my bank I used to fund my new account was charged twice.,2025-01-29,3
sucks,2025-01-29,3
awful service,2025-01-28,3
Everytime I make a payment my card gets shut off and when I try to fix it the app malfunctions its rare for the app to work anyway I'll be switching banks soon,2025-01-28,3
This app is easy to use for simple stuff but when I actually had an issue I got no help at all. 15 years with cb and I'm about to leave.,2025-01-28,3
Always crashes. Never recognize biometrics and will force you to change your password even after you tried the correct password. Just locks you out.,2025-01-28,3

Horrible never loads please fix update your app can never get into account keeps circling saying we're getting your account,2025-01-27,3
Horrible app. Keeps you in an endless loop of logging in and it automatically logs you out. Will now need to switch banks. Pathetic app,2025-01-27,3

"Website works great. Can't log into the app even though I've carefully confirmed user/password multiple times. No way to chat with them and ""contact us"" links don't actually take you anywhere to do so. If you want a bank with a good mobile app, I'd keep looking. If you're OK with checking in on PC then they could work out well. UPDATE I'm moving all my money out of this bank. There's too many other banks that have a functioning mobile app and I've given them a year or two.",2025-01-25,3
Absolutely trash,2025-01-25,3

"This app sucks, can't look at statements or tax documents. Says no eligible accounts for documents and no tax forms yet (account is almost 5 years old now) If you go into your account and try to look at the documents there, nothing happens when you click on them. Can't log into mobile website either, just says""error, trying again will fix it or come back later"" but doesn't. Only way for me to get to the documents are to go to a computer and log in.",2025-01-23,3
App makes you reset password Everytime it closes(not even log out). You can sometimes bypass by clear storage and cache and login with login and password. Don't use fingerprint.,2025-01-21,3
Worst bank ever. Made an account and deposited a check. I have waited a week already and now they are telling me it will not clear until the end of the month. I strongly advise everyone to not use this bank,2025-01-21,3
It often doesn't allow me to sign in on the app. I have to go to my computer to see my balance and other information. There is a serious problem with this app.,2025-01-21,3
The app doesn't work half the time and they closed every branch within 45 miles of me.,2025-01-21,3
This app needs an update cat do half of the s stuff I need to do going online is 100% better,2025-01-18,3
Your app and website absolutely fail most of the time simply because of the login issues I have. I always seem to have to call to get my password fixed and 2 minutes later after hanging up my login info still has errors from your own system failure! Same goes for your website too!,2025-01-17,3
"If I could give this app 0 stars, I would... it's a glorified browser that never works, and quite frankly, it is dangerous to the consumer. If there was an emergency where I needed to transfer or access my money, the hoops they make you jump through are ridiculous when the app decides it doesn't want to work (which is every time). PASSWORD RECOVERY DOES NOT EXIST ON THIS ""APP""",2025-01-17,3

App is AWFUL !!?,2025-01-14,3
Why is your app always broken.,2025-01-13,3
I can't take any action from the app with my account. All I can do is view my account. I have a line of credit and I can't access the line of credit from the account and I also can't pay down the balance either. Honestly I would've chosen a different lender if I knew this would've been the experience,2025-01-13,3
I was illegaly charged by a company after they were supposed to be blocked from processing a payment from me. Then told I was gonna receive a credit which I never received. Was told they would cancel my debit card and issue a new one so I can't be charged again by this company. I was told for the inconvenience they were gonna waive the express shipping fee for the new card. Next day I see a $12 emergency card fee on my account. I record my phone calls so i have him lying saved.,2025-01-03,3
Need updated,2025-01-03,3
"The most annoying app. Any time you need to change pages to look at something you'll have to verify via text, even after it says you won't need to verify again. Every single time, I have to have them text me a code, can't just log in like it says. So it lies and makes you have to call to get some number they tell you won't need every time... But rest assured, you will have to waste your time calling and texting every...single...time. I hate it",2025-01-02,3
Terrible!! Can't get to account if all information is 100% correct on the app..,2025-01-01,3
The app doesn't show line of credit details. And now online version won't allow me to log in ever. Even after multiple calls with technical support. I am about to close my account. This is frustrating if you can bank virtually.,2025-01-01,3
"Works fine on mobile data, but takes up to 10 minutes to start or log in on wifi Not impressed",2025-01-01,3
Citizens bank does not have their customers back when scammed. I was charged illegaly 2 days into a 7 day free trail. Put a dispute in with screenshots of everything possible to prove I was done wrong. I never got my $15 back. I was charged again $15 from the same company which i have no account with. I canceled my free trial and had no account. Now I'm $30 out and citizens bank has done nothing. I had to file a claim with the better business bureau. I am now closing my account with citizens,2024-12-30,3

App & Bank keep the app in an unbalanced state to continue to over charge overdraft fees to customers. check all negative reviews to confirm this reality! Peace of mind is an illusion they want you to feel assured while they sneak in multiple fees. Notifications are not accurate as well so BEWARE OF CITIZENS BANK & THE WAY THEY CONDUCT BUSINESS! Dissatisfied Customer! On multiple levels,2024-12-12,3
"The worst bank ever exists should be out of business scamming people erroderating their words I was so wrong about the four star review no one should ever and never sign up with them especially when ATMs rob your money like really come on like I wish they are out of business and I was step on toes like saying"" don't sign with them you they will hustle you straight dirt bag move that is low and that messed up the business for banks that make you all look bad and I have a lot of problems years ago",2024-12-10,3

Horrible experience always upgrading,2024-12-03,3
"App stopped working, refuses to let me change my password.",2024-12-02,3
Worst app and bank ever. If I was rich they would be kissing my butt to make sure the app works. Since I'm not they don't care about me. I'm an US citizen living in Europe. It does not work unless I pay for a VPN service to connect. Even then the app is awful. I changed from 2 stars to 1 star. I can't enter my Hungarian account number. I had to bother my 84 year old mother. Every time I sign in. It wants to call the US landline for a code. This is the worst app ever.,2024-11-28,3
"Good job, now I cant use the app at all anymore. You require an update to the app, and dont let me login or use it if I dont update. Here's the issue- I CANT UPDATE IT BECAUSE YOU DECIDED TO STOP ALLOWING ANYBODY ON 8.0 OREO FROM USING IT. I guess I'll just move to a bank that doesnt discriminate based on an OS version.

Your app sucks Everytime I log in on the app it wants to verify that's it's me which is ok other than it doesn't send text messages and it calls my phone with no ring heard and leaves a voicemail that's 6 seconds long and only says please hang up. It does not allow or offer verification code to be sent thru email like the web site does . I'm getting really tired of calling customer service and having to speak or try to understand someone that doesn't speak English. I'mAbout ready to change banks,2024-11-23,3

bad bank,2025-02-17,4
It sucks. All it does is load / spin. I can never get on my account. Doesn't matter morning noon or night. This app is horrible. I hate it. Citizen Bank needs to figure this out because it's an inconvenience. Also trying to come up with 500 letters / words is an inconvenience when it doesn't require that much detail to describe the problem. I think they do it so people won't write a review. It's ridiculous. But I will just keep typing to take upspace even if it not about the app. Figure,2025-02-16,4

Honestly I would've chosen a different lender if I knew this would've been the experience,2025-01-13,4
I was illegaly charged by a company after they were supposed to be blocked from processing a payment from me. Then told I was gonna receive a credit which I never received.

I was told for the inconvenience they were gonna waive the express shipping fee for the new card. Next day I see a $12 emergency card fee on my account.

bad bank,2025-02-17,5
It sucks. All it does is load / spin. I can never get on my account. Doesn't matter morning noon or night. This app is horrible. I hate it. Citizen Bank needs to figure this out because it's an inconvenience. Also trying to come up with 500 letters / words is an inconvenience when it doesn't require that much detail to describe the problem. I think they do it so people won't write a review. It's ridiculous. But I will just keep typing to take upspace even if it not about the app. Figure,2025-02-16,5

It would be great if the app worked. As it is EVERY single week it is locking my account and making me change the password. Ive had over 18 passwords in the last 2 months.

I can't take any action from the app with my account. All I can do is view my account. I have a line of credit and I can't access the line of credit from the account and I also can't pay down the balance either. Honestly I would've chosen a different lender if I knew this would've been the experience,2025-01-13,5
I was illegaly charged by a company after they were supposed to be blocked from processing a payment from me. Then told I was gonna receive a credit which I never received. Was told they would cancel my debit card and issue a new one so I can't be charged again by this company. I was told for the inconvenience they were gonna waive the express shipping fee for the new card. Next day I see a $12 emergency card fee on my account. I record my phone calls so i have him lying saved.,2025-01-03,5
Need updated,2025-01-03,5
"The most annoying app. Any time you need to change pages to look at something you'll have to verify via text, even after it says you won't need to verify again.

But rest assured, you will have to waste your time calling and texting every...single...time. I hate it",2025-01-02,5
Terrible!! Can't get to account if all information is 100% correct on the app..,2025-01-01,5

Citizens bank does not have their customers back when scammed. I was charged illegaly 2 days into a 7 day free trail. Put a dispute in with screenshots of everything possible to prove I was done wrong. I never got my $15 back. I was charged again $15 from the same company which i have no account with. I canceled my free trial and had no account. Now I'm $30 out and citizens bank has done nothing. I had to file a claim with the better business bureau. I am now closing my account with citizens,2024-12-30,5

It does not work unless I pay for a VPN service to connect. Even then the app is awful. I changed from 2 stars to 1 star. I can't enter my Hungarian account number.

What is the point of speaking to agents when they tell you to try again later. This bank has been giving me problems with online banking forever. Stop changing things where you can't get in anymore.
