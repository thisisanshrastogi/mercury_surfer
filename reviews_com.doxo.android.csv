I try to pay my bill online through Doxo. I forgot my password so when I try to reset my password they sent me a number and when I plugged it in the number they said that I need help and on the third time they told me to reach out to them and when I reach out to them they say that they can help me to change my password they sent me another verification number when I plug it in they tell me that I have problems to reach out and that repeats over and over and I never changed my password..,2025-05-13,1

This app Isn't helpful. The companies that allow you use this app for payment don't even know that you have paid using the app. It takes forever for them to relay the payment. It does not go through directly to the company that you are actually paying. BE CAREFUL THIS CAN CAUSE YOU TO BE DELIQUENT!,2024-11-08,1

"I would check to see if I owe anything, and when I click to pay bill, it would not reveal if I owe anything, just telling me how much I want to pay.",2024-09-10,1
Why is it app not working? I pay bills in 2023 but in this year not works. But they buying in my account every month fee charge???? 🤕🤕🤕,2024-09-09,1

The app took it upon itself to try to make a payment without my permission and delayed my payments making some payments late. Your payment isn't paid right away. Instead they want to make sure your payment is completed with them then transfer the money to the intended company.,2024-06-13,1

"I really don't like paying the monthly amount to Doxo for premium, but my bills are always paid on time, and you know exactly what day the money is coming out of your account to avoid any overdrawn payments. I had a bill paid on Doxo, and the account it was sent to refused it solely because they only take money from their site. Doxo informed me right away that the transaction was refused and reversed, and my money was refunded and returned to my account within 48 hours. Never had a problem.",2024-07-30,4
Doxo is a good app. I would highly recommend it to anyone.,2024-07-17,4

"App is very easy to process bill payments and track their status. However, it will be great if they allow Amex for payment . I tried Apple pay but still unable to use Amex only Visa & Master are supported.",2024-05-21,4
I really like the app.Only issue I had problems When trying to add /make payment on second account.(Same Company) It would default to primary account.After two attempts.I stop trying so I mail that one in.It's still a great app and I'll continue to use it Thank You.And have a great one😎👍,2024-04-23,4
I think this app would be great for people who want to pay their bills thru an app. I'm actually looking more for an app that would allow me to simply track and mark bills as paid,2024-04-11,4
I just wish I could set the actual date for the payment,2024-03-21,4
