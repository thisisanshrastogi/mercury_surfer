Didn't need this change and take to long to work can't get into my account,2025-05-19,1
What's the point of freezing your account if a fraudulent charge is still going to be allowed to go through???? Worst credit card I've had to date and there's more than just that reason.,2025-05-19,1
forced me to update at gunpoint when I was in an emergency : ),2025-05-18,1
unintuitive interface,2025-05-18,1
Mandatory app updates over and over and over and over.,2025-05-17,1
"The app is so glitchy or just does not work. Over half the time, when I try to log in, I get an error message to close the app and try again. Fix the issue, please.",2025-05-16,1

horrible. You have to change your phone to use this app. I will be changing my credit card instead!,2025-05-10,1
App won't open.,2025-05-09,1
"Don't waste your time on this app. I just got my payroll checks started going into this account and they closed it down. Such worthless app and banking. Direct deposits just don't happen over night.

I had multiple charges on my card from out-of-state and overseas and because I made a payment towards my credit card. They deemed that those were valid transactions and refused to credit back the amount. Discover is pathetic.,2025-05-07,1
it's not updating,2025-05-07,1
horrible,2025-05-05,1

I ordered a new card a long time ago and I've still never gotten it's been months.,2025-05-04,1
"DO NOT USE DISCOVER. They are behind the times and can't keep up with customer satisfaction like Chase or Capital One. I had to dispute a charge from a vendor that never sent my product and it seems that Discover put me on the back burner, when other companies were on it and got my money right away. So I'm done with this Mickey Mouse operation.",2025-05-01,1
"CONSTANTLY having issues logging into this app! It actually tries to blame my device. That's hilarious, since I can sign into all the other apps on my phone. Not to mention, this app is the only app that gives me💩",2025-04-30,1
the app hasent been opening for almost the last month. it tells you to update and I have the most updated version and still nothing. please fix soon.,2025-04-30,1
"Disappointed that the early payroll deposit is so much slower than Chime. Discover is telling me maybe 2 days early and Chime would always do 4 and sometimes 5 days early. well it's a month later and I'm still experiencing the same issues, direct deposit is not deposited early, at least not the same way other Banks do it. chime Bank in Fargo bank will do it five and sometimes 6 Days early. they keep replying with the same cut and paste message by different people",2025-04-29,1
"After years of never having a problem, you just close my account. shaddy practice.",2025-04-29,1
Can't even read a secure message or upload dispute evidence. Total Garbage! so dumb that I need to login to my computer to upload dispute evidence! Email isn't allowed either! App is totally worthless for resolving charge dispute. The banks let you use you app to login if you don't use your password when you're only biometric. So make your app let us login to PC as well like bank security so we don't need to reset our passwords since we haven't used them in years!,2025-04-26,1
can't make a payment,2025-04-26,1
the IT people at Discovery suck constantly updating their app constantly moving to the app to the back page of your mobile phone,2025-04-25,1

can't get into app,2025-04-23,1
After so many years being witht them they can dissapoint you in style.Terrible service.Terrible customer response.,2025-04-22,1
I kept receiving charges from LA Fitness and they would not allow me to cancel my membership. Discover kept allowing them to charge my account. I tried to cancel this membership for two years whilst paying the silly charge that Discover kept approving. I was a Discover customer for 24 years! Unfortunately there wasn't anything else I could do but to cancel my account. These were fraudulent charges. Update: Discover sent me to collections but finally the gym payments stopped. This seems criminal,2025-04-22,1
fraud department is unhelpful,2025-04-20,1
Not working!! Please fix this asap,2025-04-19,1

You should be able to charge back pending transactions instead of HAVING TO PAY INTEREST on something that shouldn't BE THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE,2025-04-18,1
"I've grown fed up with a quirk of the app where it removes itself from my desktop/launcher every time it updates. This means that, if I want to keep my app folders organized the way I like them, I need to find the Discover app in my app list/drawer and add it back to its folder ~1x/week. This is the only app I use that I notice this behavior with. I will restore my review to five stars as soon as I see that the app stays put where I put it.",2025-04-18,1
keeps changing pages before I can answer . can't log in,2025-04-18,1
Starting to implement some suspicious activities like referring you to sites they are reporting have your data. Probably going to look for another card.,2025-04-18,1
the app spuld have running balance as default. not an option to pick. low key shady,2025-04-17,1
"I can no longer log in via this app. When I put in my password it just reloads the landing page and it seems to get caught in a loop that triggers the ""too many failed log-in attempts"" flag and locks my online account. Logging in from the desktop site works fine.",2025-04-16,1
This company doesn't protect information from being hacked!,2025-04-16,1
to much trouble,2025-04-15,1
sucks,2025-04-15,1
"Discover is a company that loves to steal your money. Why am I being charged a monthly interest that's higher than my monthly payments? How the hell do you expect people to be able to pay off their balances? Oh that's right, you want people to stay in debt so you can continue to rip them off.. DO NOT SIGN UP FOR A DISCOVER CARD. There's no way in hell people can afford to pay $144 in interest charges when they aren't even using the damn card. 🙄",2025-04-15,1
I'M LOCKED OUT SO NOT HAPPY ABOUT THAT AND IT WASN'T ME TRYING TO GET IN. I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT A LONG STANDING COMPANY AS THIS WOULD HAVE FOUND A WAY TO SAFE GUARD THEIR CARD HOLDERS.,2025-04-14,1

unable to log in a majority of time,2025-04-11,1
"For the last few weeks the app has not been opening for me. It just says ""We're sorry. Something went wrong. Please close the app and try again."" I really liked the app. So this is super frustrating. I've restarted the app. I've restarted my phone (s25 Ultra). Un-installed and reinstalled. Nothing changes. Still get the same generic error. Saw there was an update and downloaded that. No dice.",2025-04-11,1
After last update 4/2 app constantly crashes! Can't login half the time. Sorry something went wrong please close app and try again! Useless!,2025-04-11,1
my Moto X4 still works great so there's no reason you can't create the app to still work on it,2025-04-10,1
"9 months went by without being ""eligible"" to use Zelle, whatever stupidity that means. Just closed my account since there's no reason to have an account I never use. So difficult to get that fixed, but closing the account took seconds. You pretty much prefer to lose clients rather than helping out. Interesting.",2025-04-10,1
with the new update I'm unable to log in to use the app at all it kept saying something went wrong please close the app and try login again for several days already,2025-04-10,1

The app will not let me sign in.,2025-04-07,1
"After the most recent March 18th, 2025 update, this app no longer works at all on my Samsung phone. It immediately crashes when I open it. I actually have never noticed any major bugs until after this most recent ""bug fix"" update.",2025-04-06,1
"I see I'm not the only one unhappy with the new update, that just showed up on 11-1-24 on my phone. Now it's saying my phone is not compatible anymore. I love the app I had and I'm not going to get a new phone either. The same thing happened with Capital one app too.",2025-04-05,1

Quick view never works. they took the small widget away so even when i can get it working, i need a whole section of home screen to use it. i used to have a 2x3 quick view widget but now i only get a 4x4 quick view widget. who made this application? Monkeys on Cocaine?",2025-04-02,1
every time this app updates I lose access to my account it's a pain to call Everytime just to check my account,2025-04-01,1
Even with credit score close to 700 my APR was 28%. Credit cards are full proof of your ENSLAVEMENT!,2025-03-30,1
"app is okay, customer service employees are nice, I just find the institution itself to be incredibly predatory. but I know writing a negative review on google play of all places isn't going to do anything to take away their power. i'm just surprised how low the bar has gotten.",2025-03-30,1
terrible service? sometimes the card works but mostly it doesn't work? I need another bank account to cover what discover bank doesn't do! I spend more time with customer service than I do trying to use the card?,2025-03-29,1
My phone doesn't use 8.0 so cannot update sending worthless emails telling you to check this or that that is no good you should make it easier for people with older phones to use your app,2025-03-29,1

"Trying to log in with update and the login page freezes, can't use it",2025-03-26,1
what an absolute joke. So you're telling me The 2 bank accounts and 1 pre paid credit card and 1 CD That I have had with a credit union for 15 yo Is not a sufficient enough line of credit to approve me for a two hundred dollar card? You approved my broke ex-boyfriend.Who still lives with his mother. But the military vet with the savings account and mortgage is a no no? And what is this too many inquiries in the last 12 months I've literally never contacted you before! lol,2025-03-26,1

"It wanted to update, now I can't get into my account. Pretty pissed off. :( Horrible! Can't get into my account after it wanted to update",2025-03-19,1
this company is garbage I had a secured credit card which was being taken care of and paid by me and then they wanted access to my IRS documents on top of all this other stuff. I completed their documents and they still turned around and shut down my card even though it was prepaid so don't even bother with them if you're getting a secured card just go to capital one. Capital one is way better and so much less hassle.,2025-03-19,1
Counterintuitive. They need to take lessons from Chase and Citibank and revamp their app for better user experience.,2025-03-19,1
This app sucks. Zelle doesnt work.,2025-03-19,1
"zelle has been broken for almost a year, only works on my iPhone or web browser. 3 android device neither of them can send zelle.",2025-03-19,1
"Why tell me i have a message, but not let me read thd message",2025-03-17,1
"If there was a way to review this app w/ negative stars, I would. It barely functions. Twice a month at least, it loves to reinstall itself and remove itself from whatever file it's organized in. This app is so stupid. I hope the developers read this at some point just to acknowledge how badly they programmed it. I hate anyone involved with its inception. I have hundreds of apps installed and this one is the most annoying. I can't wait to stop banking with Discover solely because of this app.",2025-03-17,1
No longer works with my phone???,2025-03-16,1
"If you're thinking about getting a Discover card, I would not do it. While they are doing maintenance for 8 hours, you can't even use your card or have access to your money. I think Cash App is better than Discover, and that's saying a lot as customer service goes. As a small business owner, they get a -3. This is just pitiful.",2025-03-16,1
Why isn't it compatible with my device?,2025-03-15,1
The app doesn't work anymore on my Galaxy S8 and is doing a force update which says not compatible with this device. So I will just stop using this card altogether. Unless these guys provide a working version for our devices. I bet there are millions who have similar devices.,2025-03-13,1
"Was a great app when it worked, but I can't access it for the past several weeks. Emailed support. IDK if it's due to my not updating to Android 15 because of the known bricking issue with Google Pixel 6's, or some other problem. Frustrating.",2025-03-13,1
roo many hoops to jump through in order to access. used my saved username and password and it still will not allow access. says my account number changed I used my new card. what a pain.,2025-03-13,1
The app will arbitrarily change your default payment account which if you're not careful will overdraft an account that you don't use. I've had this happen twice now and customer service shrugs.,2025-03-13,1
"Apparently the app is no longer is supported on my device so I changed my score. If by some chance it changes and I'm able to use the app again, I will reverse it. I understand for most apps if the phone is older, but it's a financial app and now I'm forced to either buy a new phone or waste time using the computer. Which will impact me using the card. Its ridiculous app developers force you to buy a new phone just to use their app that has features unavailable.",2025-03-12,1
"Stay away from this company. I was really going through it and asked them for some help. They cut my interest rate for a year. Once I successfully completed this, I still couldn't use my card. When I called, I was bounced around to 4 separate departments. Then I was told my account was ""suspended"", despite the fact that I was aggressive trying to get back on track, and I did. Now, they get to decide arbitrarily if I am ""allowed"" to use my card. They are snakes. You've been warned.",2025-03-12,1
Doesn't work with latest version of Android on my Galaxy S8. Can't run and can't update.,2025-03-12,1

"It's rarely available to use and none of the updates work, it never works!!!!!",2025-03-07,1
"You can't do anything about fraudulent charges in the app. Your account will randomly be linked to old numbers, making it impossible to verify. You won't be able to call in and get support. It is actually a nightmare to have this bank. Oh, and their maintenance on Sunday nights disables your entire card and account almost weekly. Everything about the service is terrible.",2025-03-07,1
Cannot view account details/transactions,2025-03-07,1
"Updates that make older phones obsolete and punish seniors for being customers serve no purpose. Guess you want more easy money than a steady base. If your IT dept cannot figure out how to make things work with all customers, maybe you should consider their effectiveness and salaries. I spent 21 years in the military making old tech work, and find it a cop out. Guess I need to find a new place to spend my money. Good luck.",2025-03-07,1
I don't appreciate your update process removing the icon from my home screen. Other apps don't do that. It's very annoying having to put it back every time!!!,2025-03-06,1

Can not download new apps,2025-02-27,1
The app used to be fine but apparently it doesn't work anymore. I asked customer service about getting back on it and they said that they can't do anything. So I guess the only thing I can do is write it down to one star. Why is it on the Play store at all if it doesn't work?,2025-02-26,1

If anyone else is having a similar issue please document it here.

Edit- doesn't startup on OnePlus 12,2024-03-11,2
Revised review as for the last year opening the app hits you with the splash screen for 2 minute before crashing. Sometimes 3rd or 4th try works and you get one more 50:50 with the fingerprint reader. Also if you have 2 savings accounts (say husband/wife access) it doesn't put the primary holders name anywhere reasonable so you need to memorize the last 4 of your account numbers to know which saving is which if $ amounts are similar. Edit: uninstalls and reinstalls/updates don't fix this,2024-03-05,2

Not looking for help now since it won't come clearly, just a PSA I suppose.",2024-02-05,2

this company is garbage I had a secured credit card which was being taken care of and paid by me and then they wanted access to my IRS documents on top of all this other stuff. I completed their documents and they still turned around and shut down my card even though it was prepaid so don't even bother with them if you're getting a secured card just go to capital one. Capital one is way better and so much less hassle.,2025-03-19,3

Revised review as for the last year opening the app hits you with the splash screen for 2 minute before crashing. Sometimes 3rd or 4th try works and you get one more 50:50 with the fingerprint reader. Also if you have 2 savings accounts (say husband/wife access) it doesn't put the primary holders name anywhere reasonable so you need to memorize the last 4 of your account numbers to know which saving is which if $ amounts are similar.

I think Cash App is better than Discover, and that's saying a lot as customer service goes. As a small business owner, they get a -3. This is just pitiful.",2025-03-16,4
Why isn't it compatible with my device?,2025-03-15,4
The app doesn't work anymore on my Galaxy S8 and is doing a force update which says not compatible with this device. So I will just stop using this card altogether. Unless these guys provide a working version for our devices. I bet there are millions who have similar devices.,2025-03-13,4
"Was a great app when it worked, but I can't access it for the past several weeks. Emailed support. IDK if it's due to my not updating to Android 15 because of the known bricking issue with Google Pixel 6's, or some other problem. Frustrating.",2025-03-13,4
roo many hoops to jump through in order to access. used my saved username and password and it still will not allow access. says my account number changed I used my new card. what a pain.,2025-03-13,4
The app will arbitrarily change your default payment account which if you're not careful will overdraft an account that you don't use. I've had this happen twice now and customer service shrugs.,2025-03-13,4
"Apparently the app is no longer is supported on my device so I changed my score. If by some chance it changes and I'm able to use the app again, I will reverse it. I understand for most apps if the phone is older, but it's a financial app and now I'm forced to either buy a new phone or waste time using the computer. Which will impact me using the card. Its ridiculous app developers force you to buy a new phone just to use their app that has features unavailable.",2025-03-12,4
"Stay away from this company. I was really going through it and asked them for some help. They cut my interest rate for a year. Once I successfully completed this, I still couldn't use my card. When I called, I was bounced around to 4 separate departments. Then I was told my account was ""suspended"", despite the fact that I was aggressive trying to get back on track, and I did. Now, they get to decide arbitrarily if I am ""allowed"" to use my card. They are snakes. You've been warned.",2025-03-12,4

Revised review as for the last year opening the app hits you with the splash screen for 2 minute before crashing. Sometimes 3rd or 4th try works and you get one more 50:50 with the fingerprint reader.

A member since 2013 I am very pleased with Discovers and the Discover App. However one issue I have with Discover is that you have to WAIT until Discover GIVES you the option of a Balance Transfer offer before you can make a transfer. With my other financial institutions as long as the consumer has the available credit they can transfer whenever. Someone elses gain...Discovers lost 🤔. In my opinio,2025-02-24,4

App is totally worthless for resolving charge dispute. The banks let you use you app to login if you don't use your password when you're only biometric. So make your app let us login to PC as well like bank security so we don't need to reset our passwords since we haven't used them in years!,2025-04-26,5

I kept receiving charges from LA Fitness and they would not allow me to cancel my membership. Discover kept allowing them to charge my account. I tried to cancel this membership for two years whilst paying the silly charge that Discover kept approving. I was a Discover customer for 24 years! Unfortunately there wasn't anything else I could do but to cancel my account. These were fraudulent charges. Update: Discover sent me to collections but finally the gym payments stopped. This seems criminal,2025-04-22,5

this company is garbage I had a secured credit card which was being taken care of and paid by me and then they wanted access to my IRS documents on top of all this other stuff.

Revised review as for the last year opening the app hits you with the splash screen for 2 minute before crashing. Sometimes 3rd or 4th try works and you get one more 50:50 with the fingerprint reader. Also if you have 2 savings accounts (say husband/wife access) it doesn't put the primary holders name anywhere reasonable so you need to memorize the last 4 of your account numbers to know which saving is which if $ amounts are similar.

"Luckily, my phone is still new enough that it's still supported. However, every time the app updates, the shortcut on my home screen disappears! When you combine this bug with the rather frequent updates, it's pretty annoying to have to find the app in the full app list and add it back to its folder almost every time I want to use it.

"It's a clean app and easy to navigate. One gripe: ""automatic payments"" don't pay everything in your account. I like to clear my whole bill at once, but the automatic payments will only cover what was on your last invoice, not the whole sum due. I will say, they recently added the ability to set app-driven reminders to pay your bill, which is one big issue I had with the app's previous iteration, so I'm glad they made that change. The integration with savings and credit is quite helpful, too.",2024-07-06,5

Why did you disable biometrics and face ID when upgrading the app? The whole reason for biometrics and face ID is so you don't need to remember or enter in a password when logging in.
