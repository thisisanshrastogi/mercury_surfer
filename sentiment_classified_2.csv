"I really don't like paying the monthly amount to Doxo for premium, but my bills are always paid on time, and you know exactly what day the money is coming out of your account to avoid any overdrawn payments. I had a bill paid on Doxo, and the account it was sent to refused it solely because they only take money from their site. Doxo informed me right away that the transaction was refused and reversed, and my money was refunded and returned to my account within 48 hours.
