"The app promises you can get an advance up to $500, but you have to pay up front for the subscription and that is the only way to get an advance. If one reads the fine print, the advance promised can range from $2- $250, so long as you dont have any outstanding advanced. That is why you have to pay up front for the dubscription, because after you pay the $14.99 your advance may only be $5, so youd actually lose $10 first month and be stuck owing every month after.

Great option for getting extra cash fast and easy. Fees are reasonable and except for the monthly membership cost which is normal if you opt to wait for funds to deposit (3-4) days there is no charge for a cash advance. No worry of late payback as it automatically pays back with the next payday deposit and then cash advance option is available immediately after payoff. Successful consistent repayments raise the available cash advance amount. Plus it monitors linked bank accounts and spending.,2024-06-13,4,great option get extra cash fast easy fee reasonable except monthly membership cost normal opt wait fund deposit day charge cash advance worry late payback automatically pay back next payday deposit cash advance option available immediately payoff successful consistent repayment raise available cash advance amount plus monitor link bank account spending,0.078,0.808,0.115,0.6705,positive,1
