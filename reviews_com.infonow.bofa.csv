Garbage. doesn't show all transactions when filtering. it'll briefly show a payment when viewing credit card transactions and then less than .5 second will show no transactions at all. for a banking app from one of the largest banks in the world. you should be embarrassed,2025-05-24,1

"Can't turn off annoying Erica or her stupid insights. I don't want your insights on my account! You can turn off notifications but it still gives you alerts in the app for all the stupid insights. I don't know who thought it was a good idea for BOA to constantly tell their customers their account is trending towards zero, literally the last thing I want from a bank. Some might find it helpful but most don't and there should be a way to turn it off. So annoying gonna close my BOA account of 20yrs",2025-05-21,1

"Recently they changed the mobile alerts for charges made online. Before it would show you the dollar amount, so if you remember your charges you could see it and know where it came from, or if you saw an amount you don't recognize, you could then go into the app and look where that charge came from. Now it just says ""debit card has been used online, check for details"" so now EVERY SINGLE charge has to be checked to keep in top of any potential fraud. It's incredibly frustrating.",2025-05-21,1

Everything was fine until they decided the phone I have is not worth the update. I was told to get an updated phone. That's great if they're going to pay for it. In my opinion this a problem with the app development! I believe the app & it's updates should be applicable to any mobile device.,2025-05-21,1

"The phone automated services are a cursed nightmare. If the phone service requests my account number, it should at least have the decency to wait until I finish writing it to try to use it, or let the customer write a character like * to tell it finished writing the number.

"this is the most complicated bank application I have ever used. any time task, like making a payment, setting up auto pay, adding a new bank account to pay you credit card with, EVERYTHING requires an extensive amount of time trying to figure out where and how to do it. careful, they won't let you pay your credit card with a new bank account until they send small deposits to your account to ""Verify"" which takes 3 days. this is to make you late on your payment, don't be fooled. worst bank",2025-05-14,1
there's a problem with autopay I've been fighting for 4 months. canceling a scheduled pmt doesn't seem to work. autopay of full balance attaches a fixed amt that doesn't update if balance changes. sad for a large bank,2025-05-14,1
I like this card but the app is pretty awful.It's difficult to navigate and very confusing. they make it difficult to pay by displaying multiple cards to pay when there's really only one and I can never easily find amd/or change my cashback category. It's frustrating.,2025-05-14,1
After my acct being hacked I ordered a replacement card that never came so I got the virtual card only for it to just not be available to see and be locked now I have to drive 20 mins to a financial center to see about getting a replacement card but atp I just want to close my account and be done,2025-05-14,1

Set up paperless billing from the get-go, but then never received a statement, and couldn't set up a payment account via the mobile app (had to be in a web browser). Just discovered you can't even make a custom payment amount through the mobile app - only the statement balance or the minimum amount due. What a joke! Why even have a mobile app???",2025-05-14,1
"Every time I make a payment with Zelle, it submits the request twice. I click the submit button once and get the message about having recently made a similar payment.

this is the absolute worst mobile app and desktop app I have ever tried to use. All it does is loop you around to things that don't let you proceed with the transaction that you are working toward. it's absurd I've been on the phone with them for multiple times in 2 months and they have no clue why their websites and their mobile apps don't work properly. You can't even make a payment or transfer money into your account. I don't recommend this for anyone. dumb programming and operational results,2025-05-10,1

"I avoid using their card and app for 90% of my purchases because the app doesn’t offer an option to automatically pay the full statement balance, unlike Amex, Chase, or even basic credit unions.

This app is very hard to navigate. it feels like you have to jump through so many non-essential hoops just to make a payment. You are not able to immediately see that your payment has posted to your account. The only way I knew it went through is that when I tried to make another payment (because I didn't think it had gone through) it asked me if I wanted to make another payment today.

The app is full of bugs. It gets on verification loops asking for activation/text verification/ password input at least two or three times. Options to manage credit cards are difficult to find and they are located in different parts of the app instead of having everything related to the card in one place. Options like changing the due date should be on the app instead of having to reach out to customer service for it. You should copy what Chase do with their app and Amex online customer service.,2025-03-11,2

Now it just says ""debit card has been used online, check for details"" so now EVERY SINGLE charge has to be checked to keep in top of any potential fraud. It's incredibly frustrating.",2025-05-21,3

"The only thing I like about this app is that I don't have to search for my account and routing numbers. It takes too long for Bank of America to transfer money from one account to the next. Also, I had my checks direct deposited and it took a whole week for them to clear my payroll check. It was time for me to get paid again by the time my check cleared. I called the bank, and the rep told me it takes 7 days for BOA to clear a check, even payroll. So, I'm about to close this account.",2025-04-22,3

The app is full of bugs. It gets on verification loops asking for activation/text verification/ password input at least two or three times. Options to manage credit cards are difficult to find and they are located in different parts of the app instead of having everything related to the card in one place. Options like changing the due date should be on the app instead of having to reach out to customer service for it. You should copy what Chase do with their app and Amex online customer service.,2025-03-11,3

this is the absolute worst mobile app and desktop app I have ever tried to use. All it does is loop you around to things that don't let you proceed with the transaction that you are working toward. it's absurd I've been on the phone with them for multiple times in 2 months and they have no clue why their websites and their mobile apps don't work properly. You can't even make a payment or transfer money into your account. I don't recommend this for anyone. dumb programming and operational results,2025-05-10,4

The amount of friction in navigating and completing basic actions (especially paying a credit card) is surprising for an app from such a large bank.

This app is very hard to navigate. it feels like you have to jump through so many non-essential hoops just to make a payment. You are not able to immediately see that your payment has posted to your account. The only way I knew it went through is that when I tried to make another payment (because I didn't think it had gone through) it asked me if I wanted to make another payment today.

The app is full of bugs. It gets on verification loops asking for activation/text verification/ password input at least two or three times. Options to manage credit cards are difficult to find and they are located in different parts of the app instead of having everything related to the card in one place.

My experience is bank of america allows scammers to go in my account after I have asked plenty of times to alert me if it you see I never affiliated with the scammer but five times I had to report my money taken and get a new card I think it's someone that works for bank of america I'm getting the news involved if it happens again but thanks for returning the money while investigating God B less,2025-02-23,4

BOA is not really customer friendly anymore. It makes no sense that all your drive up windows closed and that your not open on Saturdays to serve working families who go to work before you open and get off work after you close. BOA should develop new policies to be consumer friendly.,2025-02-12,4

"Generally very positive. Except for writing checks. BoA limits my account to 20 checks per statement cycle before I get charged a 45¢ per-check fee. If you don't want that fee, depending on all your other banking needs, look elsewhere. I have two business checking accounts and the 2nd doesn't have the check penalty. I now split deposits between the two accounts. The net result is BoA loses deposits into six figures annually so they can charge me 45¢ per check.",2025-05-23,4

Easy cheesy. The pop-ups should be able to permanently removed. The BIGGEST bummer is the lag of time for a payment to be applied. There is no lag in getting the charge on the account so it should be just as fast to get a payment to clear. ALL of my other cards post within 30 mins of payment. So I know it's not my financial institution.,2025-05-09,4

This app is very hard to navigate. it feels like you have to jump through so many non-essential hoops just to make a payment. You are not able to immediately see that your payment has posted to your account. The only way I knew it went through is that when I tried to make another payment (because I didn't think it had gone through) it asked me if I wanted to make another payment today. There is just so much unnecessary information as they try to push more product on you.,2025-03-19,5

The app is full of bugs. It gets on verification loops asking for activation/text verification/ password input at least two or three times. Options to manage credit cards are difficult to find and they are located in different parts of the app instead of having everything related to the card in one place. Options like changing the due date should be on the app instead of having to reach out to customer service for it. You should copy what Chase do with their app and Amex online customer service.,2025-03-11,5

I been with Bank of America for over 10 year's. it works great that I'm able to over my app and see what's going on with my account whenever I want. it's a little slow longing in. if you need to call them for help they get rings on what ever you need help with.,2025-05-10,5
good,2025-05-09,5
Easy cheesy. The pop-ups should be able to permanently removed. The BIGGEST bummer is the lag of time for a payment to be applied. There is no lag in getting the charge on the account so it should be just as fast to get a payment to clear. ALL of my other cards post within 30 mins of payment. So I know it's not my financial institution.,2025-05-09,5

Easy to find stuff and pleasant to the eye! I've been with BofA over 30 years and I have no complaints until today.

My biggest problem with this app is that it does not take the funds from your account until the check is cashed or funds are received by the payee. This makes it very easy to overdraw and for BofA to collect fees. We will be changing banks as soon as possible.,2025-04-25,5
