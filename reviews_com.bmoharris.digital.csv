"So I transferred over from Wells Fargo to BMO and I made 3 deposits one for both my checking and savings account for 350$ each and one deposit for 500$, for no reason or explanation my two deposits for 700$ total were returned back to my closed Wells Fargo account but my deposit of 500$ made it through just fine, and BMO screwed this up and won't admit to it so I'm just out 700$ , I have proof and the transaction numbers for the money Wells Fargo sent back to BMO but i still have not received it",2025-05-18,1
"After years of no issues at all, for the last few months the app locks me out of my account every couple of days. I'm on my 7th password and have to call in to get it unlocked because I'm not charging it anymore. The phone reps tell me I'm entering the password incorrectly even though I'm not. This last week has gone to daily lock outs. I talked to a supervisor a month ago. I've never had an issue like this with any app. They aren't giving me any choice but to leave.",2025-05-15,1

"This bank has to be one of the most frustrating banks I've ever had the misfortune to use. Website and app are always down. Their actual atms and bank tellers never count my money correctly. it's like they're skimming off the top of our hard earned money, and we just let them get away with it. Can never connect with anyone over the phone to talk about any of this either cause Im always on hold for 30 minutes. Good lord. 0 stars.",2025-05-08,1
completely intolerable response time to cash cheque's virtually for new members. as a new member I found It hard to swallow that I had to wait an entire week for the same deposit I had as before. going without your pay till the next pay date and not sure to expect if the next one will have the same issues. completely off putting for new members to want to continue to bank with you. rivals like PNC may offer better online banking not sure at the moment if I will keep the account.,2025-05-05,1
"I haven't had an account since 2023, bank of the west was better and the merge with y'all was terrible. My question is why yall sending me a email talking about you guys closed my bmo zelle account?? I don't even use y'all so lose my information already üòÇüòÇüòÇ",2025-05-04,1

would not recommend bmo to anyone.,2025-04-18,1
downloaded app to try to get my 80 yr old dad his rewards points because they canceled his card for no reason. he called and asked why and they basically said because they could and didn't know why but they owe him rewards of 147$ and being on a fixed income that meant alot to him. he spent hours on the phone multiple times and all they did was send him back and forth until an old retired man got tired and gave up. Dirty tricks from a dirty company. never missed a payment and this is how your t,2025-04-18,1

I don't like how you have to change the filter every time. I would like to see all my transactions for the past 30 days. I do not wanna see just the last 2 days. I don't like changing the filter from custom to 30 days. Stop taking money from my savings without letting me know your scam for paper statements. money eaters in America üê∑,2025-04-04,1
"I enjoyed the app until I went to make a credit card payment and they removed the statement balance option so now you have to navigate to the cards statements, search for the previous month's pdf, write down the statement balance, then go back to make a payment, select ""other"" and type your statement balance. Removing this already existing basic feature from the app is very scary from BMO.",2025-04-03,1

bmo has lock me out of the app and hijacked my money,2025-03-27,1
"Constantly asks me for verification every time I open the app, and won't let me choose which verification methods I even want to be options. As an expat who can no longer have a US number, I need to rely on family who lives 7 hours behind to give me codes ever time I want to check my account. Allow us to add new devices or remove old ones, and to use email as a verification method and this wouldn't be an issue. What if people lose their phone and don't have another number on file?

"Ah, BMO. One moment, I'm a responsible adult locking my card for security, and the next, I'm staring at a 500 Internal Server Error like I just asked the app to perform rocket science. Did I request a simple card lock, or did I accidentally hack into the mainframe? The app worked fine yesterday, but today? Nope. It straight-up gave up.

The worst banking app in world history. Wipe the data and hire a new company to program an entirely new app.,2025-03-07,1
"Watch out! BMO likes to sneak tricks in to the app. If you deposit a check, they try to push a $60 charge to access your money right away. You need to carefully read through everything now to avoid the trap. They won't let you opt out for more than a few weeks hoping eventually you will make a $60 mistake.

Mobile deposit feature is non-functioning. It won't recognize the amount on the check and won't allow deposits. I've been messaging them for months and no improvement. Have to use other bank accounts to deposit checks and transfer since I have no branches in my region. I would leave this bank if they hadn't bought Bank of the West and my HELOC. Stuck with this garbage software...,2025-02-15,1

BMO is taking money out of my bank account and not posting it to my loan for up to 5 days after! This means i am paying interest on an incorrect amount! I am not happy with this FRAUDULENT bank! Yes.... BMO is stealing my money!! I will be financing with another bank ASAP!,2025-01-23,1
This application is very suspicious as it is very similar to the normal banking app but when you put in your sign in info it states your information is incorrect. After which it asks you for your social insurance number as a proof of identification when trying to reset your password.,2025-01-20,1
Boo this bank,2025-01-16,1

This app is always down for maintenance always near midnight or just in general everytime I need to move money around. This the only bank app thats always down for something. It never warns you about scheduled maintenance or anything. Just always down. It's getting to the point that it's just becoming ridiculous! They need to üõë stop this BS. And not be able to be locking people from accessing their funds constantly.,2025-01-16,1
"BMO do a better job with your App... lately every single night at 1am CT your bank app goes down and does not work for up to 3 hours! People deserve to have access to their accounts 24/7, three times this week your online banking functions were not online. This is ridiculous",2025-01-15,1

So I'm not resetting my password or username if it works!! There is no one to contact to fix it will probably just uninstall and just use the computer which is extremely inconvenient but whatever.,2025-01-10,1

"DO NOT TRUST THIS BANK! A fraudulent account was opened in my name months ago, and they keep claiming it is closed, but i continue to receive mail from them demanding money or it will impact my credit.

"slow, slow, slow. I've un-installed and re-installed, and still painfully slow. I'm on a 1/2gig network, so it's not that. All my other apps run fast, so it's just BMO. Bank of the West app was faster... I can't believe I'm actually saying that.",2024-12-18,1

"Worst bank. Fraud alerts don't come via text nor email. They don't know how to correct nor fix declines for their system assuming fraud.

Instead I was provided a number to customer service, which proved as backwards as the app. I'm grateful I didn't deposit money, else BMO would've held it ransom, as it required I provide notarized declaration of identity. I highly recommend folks stay away from BMO",2024-09-07,1

Did I request a simple card lock, or did I accidentally hack into the mainframe? The app worked fine yesterday, but today? Nope. It straight-up gave up. No error explanation, no warning‚Äîjust a virtual shoulder shrug. I half expect my phone to start smoking and customer service department is a joke",2025-03-16,2

"Watch out! BMO likes to sneak tricks in to the app. If you deposit a check, they try to push a $60 charge to access your money right away. You need to carefully read through everything now to avoid the trap. They won't let you opt out for more than a few weeks hoping eventually you will make a $60 mistake. I think it's time to find a more reputable bank.",2025-03-03,2

Mobile deposit feature is non-functioning. It won't recognize the amount on the check and won't allow deposits. I've been messaging them for months and no improvement. Have to use other bank accounts to deposit checks and transfer since I have no branches in my region. I would leave this bank if they hadn't bought Bank of the West and my HELOC.

This application is very suspicious as it is very similar to the normal banking app but when you put in your sign in info it states your information is incorrect. After which it asks you for your social insurance number as a proof of identification when trying to reset your password.,2025-01-20,2
Boo this bank,2025-01-16,2

"Ah, BMO. One moment, I'm a responsible adult locking my card for security, and the next, I'm staring at a 500 Internal Server Error like I just asked the app to perform rocket science. Did I request a simple card lock, or did I accidentally hack into the mainframe? The app worked fine yesterday, but today? Nope. It straight-up gave up. No error explanation, no warning‚Äîjust a virtual shoulder shrug. I half expect my phone to start smoking and customer service department is a joke",2025-03-16,3
"Deposited a payroll check and the ""back end"" of their system put a 10+ day extra hold on my funds so I will be late on my car payment due to BMO. I will likely be opening an account with another bank with my next check... beyond outrageous.",2025-03-12,3

"Watch out! BMO likes to sneak tricks in to the app. If you deposit a check, they try to push a $60 charge to access your money right away. You need to carefully read through everything now to avoid the trap. They won't let you opt out for more than a few weeks hoping eventually you will make a $60 mistake. I think it's time to find a more reputable bank.",2025-03-03,3

Mobile deposit feature is non-functioning. It won't recognize the amount on the check and won't allow deposits. I've been messaging them for months and no improvement. Have to use other bank accounts to deposit checks and transfer since I have no branches in my region. I would leave this bank if they hadn't bought Bank of the West and my HELOC.

This application is very suspicious as it is very similar to the normal banking app but when you put in your sign in info it states your information is incorrect. After which it asks you for your social insurance number as a proof of identification when trying to reset your password.,2025-01-20,3
Boo this bank,2025-01-16,3

I was with a local bank because I got sick of all the big bank bs and their invasion of privacy. BMO bought them out and i stayed because they had the same outlook.

So it deceives me into thinking I have more money in my account then I do. Overdraft is better business for them. Not me. Like I said it SUCKS üòî,2024-10-19,4

"I was formerly with Bank of the West, now merged with BMO. I have tried multiple times to achieve digital access since my problem-free BoWest mobile access was abruptly ended. The app insists I create a new ID, but does not recognize or accept me, my acct no, or SS#. I even went into my local branch to seek help, only to find that the folks there were not trained to help with the mobile app.",2024-10-01,4
The worst bank. Closed my account without any notification.,2024-09-27,4

This has been the most horrible experience I've ever had with a bank and banking app . No one at customer service knows how to update an email address nor the reps who work inside the branch . I e been dealing with this issue for three days now . What a mistake I made when I signed up with this bank . I do not recommend this bank or app to anyone.,2024-09-13,4
"Very glitchy on amount available, pending purchases and not logging in at times.",2024-09-13,4
I was informed that the response to my review was automated and I should ignore it. edit: I called the provided number and they couldn't make changes to the applications UI. they were also unable to provide the feedback to your dev teams or UI teams. It doesn't handle increased display or font size properly. many features can't be used with out setting them to default. but then I can't see them.,2024-09-11,4

I've called customer service and no improvement. I uninstalled the app, added it back, and again, same error message. I'm unable to go to a branch office. BMO please fix the problem.",2024-09-07,4
"BMO's the worst bank I've ever had the misfortune of dealing with. I signed up for a checking account and was locked out as I attempted to fund it. Neither email address nor phone number could be used to verify my identity. Instead I was provided a number to customer service, which proved as backwards as the app. I'm grateful I didn't deposit money, else BMO would've held it ransom, as it required I provide notarized declaration of identity. I highly recommend folks stay away from BMO",2024-09-07,4
"This app never works properly. I have literally spent 45 minutes trying to deposit a check. But it still keeps giving me a system error. And that they're gonna get it fixed.

The worst online banking experience possible you have no control of your account if you have any problems you always have to call between a certain hours and they keep letting the same problems happen over and over again without giving you notifications after you sign up for notifications this is truly the worst bank I have ever been with I will be leaving them next week because they are truly pathetic do not I repeat do not use this bank,2024-08-30,4
"This is the absolute worst app. The biometrics never work, then I have to put my password in and it says that my password is wrong (even though I literally have a screenshot of the exact password I used). I am forced to change my password about 2 to 3 times a week due to it telling me it does not recognize my password. I'm thinking of changing banks because this is horrible.",2024-08-26,4

"Kinda of slow and lagging. Could be better tbh. Also mobile deposit is not even worth it. It takes 2 days and more when it's the weekend. Don't understand the concept of it. Other banks let you have your funds immediately, even if it's just partially. But I guess other banks are better at that",2024-08-23,4
"All the money the pay for there Commercials, should be applied to fixing all the problems they have when logging into a person account. . I have only be able to log in to my account once.

"Mobile deposit suddenly doesn't work. Tried on multiple devices, with flash, no flash, different background, ect. Keeps saying I entered the wrong amount on the check. I even had someone else independently verify I wasn't going insane. Spent over an hour on the phone with them for them to say they can't do anything. I don't have access to a physical branch.

"I find BMO Bank to be unresponsive and uncooperative. They have become an obstacle to selling my boat. While the online site clearly shows the loan to be paid off, BMO has not released the lien and can't seem to provide an explanation as to why other than blaming it on their policies. But, NYS law requires a lien to be released ""immediately"" upon pay-off. As an update and response to BMO's response, one staff member tried to help, but others continued the run-around. Try a different one",2024-07-18,4

I was with a local bank because I got sick of all the big bank bs and their invasion of privacy. BMO bought them out and i stayed because they had the same outlook.

It would be nice if all the functions worked all the time. Mobile deposit tells me the amount I entered doesn't match the amount on the check (yes it does). Then when you do the chat for help all they tell you is to re-download the app and if that doesn't work go into the bank to deposit the checks. News flash! That's what I was trying to avoid but thanks anyway.,2025-02-09,4

I truly love BMO as a banking institution. I would have given them five stars had they offered 2 day advance direct deposit availability and better overdraft protection. If overdraft protection is approved and added to an account then the account holder should have the ability to use it when needed. Don't offer overdraft protection if it's still at the bank's discretion.,2024-10-26,4

"App used to be mostly fine but now it's riddled with BMO product advertisement. I open the app and have to click a button to close and add. And then there's ads while scrolling through my accounts.

Otherwise no real functional issues I have seen so far, it's a simple app that does the job but suddenly has lots of product placement.",2024-10-07,4
The app works pretty well for the most part but trying to deposit a check has become a chore. Keeps saying the amount put in doesn't match what the check says when it in fact does.

Instead I was provided a number to customer service, which proved as backwards as the app. I'm grateful I didn't deposit money, else BMO would've held it ransom, as it required I provide notarized declaration of identity. I highly recommend folks stay away from BMO",2024-09-07,5

It would be nice if all the functions worked all the time. Mobile deposit tells me the amount I entered doesn't match the amount on the check (yes it does). Then when you do the chat for help all they tell you is to re-download the app and if that doesn't work go into the bank to deposit the checks. News flash! That's what I was trying to avoid but thanks anyway.,2025-02-09,5

I truly love BMO as a banking institution. I would have given them five stars had they offered 2 day advance direct deposit availability and better overdraft protection. If overdraft protection is approved and added to an account then the account holder should have the ability to use it when needed. Don't offer overdraft protection if it's still at the bank's discretion.,2024-10-26,5

The app works pretty well for the most part but trying to deposit a check has become a chore. Keeps saying the amount put in doesn't match what the check says when it in fact does.
