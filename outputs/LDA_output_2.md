## KEY FINDINGS & RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Crisis Areas (Requiring Emergency Action):

1. **Scam Allegations (Topics 15, 13, 7)**: Users actively warning others about fraudulent practices
2. **Customer Service Collapse (Topics 15, 14, 11)**: Complete breakdown of user support
3. **Payment System Failures (Topics 15, 12, 8)**: Core functionality not working
4. **Fee Transparency Crisis (Topics 13, 12, 6)**: Hidden charges and predatory practices

### Systemic Problems:

- **Trust Erosion**: Consistent use of terms like "scam," "horrible," "terrible" across topics
- **Financial Exploitation**: Targeting vulnerable users with hidden fees
- **Operational Dysfunction**: Basic app features not working as promised
- **Communication Breakdown**: Poor user education about fees and terms

### Severity Assessment:

The lower coherence scores (0.5139-0.5270) for the most critical topics suggest these are complex, multifaceted problems that lack clear definition - making them harder to address but more urgent due to their systemic nature.

**Recommendation**: Immediate comprehensive audit of business practices, fee structures, and customer service protocols is required to prevent regulatory intervention and mass user exodus.
