"Unable to log in. It required password, text contact, biometric registration, and scanning one's driver's license, which is ridiculous since that's more than you'd need to launch a nuclear missile. It won't scan my driver's license after carefully composing the picture as requested, holding the phone as still as a sniper, and adjusting lighting for glare. I wasted nearly an hour trying to log in, then gave up. At this point I'd rather cancel my Chase account than jump through any more hoops.",2025-05-19,1
"Almost every time I try and use the app, it won't let me sign in. Even after I enter my password, have them call me with a code, and then have a picture of my driver's license scanned, it will never confirm I am me. I get the message for me to try again later, only for it to do the same routine. It only let me in when I first started using the app. The app would not let me update any information the few times it granted me access. Not worth the aggravation to use.",2025-05-20,1
Was a great app. It only works somewhat. only lets you look at your accounts. It killed fingerprint login and wont allow you to make any changes. You can see everything about your igsisting accounts but when you try to look or due anything else it tells you that it is unable to connect to Chase Bank and to try again later. Has been doing this for a couple of months. Makes one question how secure and safe it is. uninstalling for now. It raises to many questions to be safe.,2025-03-06,1
"I have great credit score, multiple credit cards with them (4), and a checking account - not enough to prevent them from closing one of my accounts bc I hadn't used that card in a year (card hadn't been working so I ordered a replacement for it). I find that pretty ridiculous so I just opened a Citi credit card and checking account and will eventually be transitioning over to them. Highly recommend understanding your client's total credit/banking picture with you before doing something dumb AF.",2025-04-03,1
"I have a masters in cs with additional degrees in math and physics. I have done the coding for interest accrual for other banks. Chase is not handling this correctly for the following situation: With a 0% balance transfer, and then make any additional purchases in a statement cycle and pay off the purchase balance every cycle and decrease the balance transfer amount, they incorrectly are calculating how much interest to charge on purchases. Customer service failed to open a support ticket. ðŸ‘Ž",2025-03-31,1
"Update: Issue still persistent in Pixel 9 Pro. The text appears above the icons in the bottom menu. I own a Pixel 7 Pro, and this issue has persisted since I started using the device. On another note, the budget planning feature is somewhat limited because it doesnâ€™t allow users to create new categories. Additionally, it would be helpful if we could pin this feature to the home page for easier access.",2025-04-11,1
"Every day, I try to log in but it takes multiple times. It freezes (spins wheel forever) then I finally get a message after closing the app multiple times and logging in. The app makes me ""verify"" my information and send a text, with a code. I then have to enter my code and password. Then I have to reset my fingerprint login again. I have tried to reinstall it several times. (Samsung Note 20)",2025-03-29,1
"GET RID OF THE FINGERPRINT SIGN IN NAG SCREEN ! I dont use the fingerprint sign in ,I use a password. Too often, when I sign in, I am promted to setup the fingerprint so I can sign in faster next time. I could sign in to my account just fine if they didn't bother me with a nag screen about signing in faster. The fingerprint nag screen needs a 'dont show again' option. This prompt is not helpful it's actually an obstruction.",2025-04-20,1
"Password reset every time. Chase is much less secure because their password requirements are so bizarre. Adding additional elements or characters risks triggering one of their automatic rejection criteria, and a longer password is less likely to pass their validity test. It's worrisome that they are so out of date on best practices protocol. They're essentially forcing use of a third party password manager or making us write them down.",2025-05-15,1
"Chase provides two options log in: password and fingerprint. I chose to enter a password. I thought the app would remember my choice. Nope! Every time I open the app, the two options show up again. I will not change my mind on signing in with a password. Chase, update the app to reflect my choice. If I want to change my mind later, allow me to look for the option to do so, i.e., place the other option I didn't choose at the bottom of the screen. Allow adults to be adults. Update app! Thanks!",2025-01-16,1
"Be careful when using the select your bank option to pay your credit cards. While the app initially gave me the impression that my bank was set up correctly by showing all the correct balances in my account, it failed to pull the correct account numbers. As a result, my payments did not go through. To make matters worse, there were no notifications or alerts indicating that the payments had failed. If a feature does not work or has not been tested for a spedific bank, it should not exist.",2025-01-22,1
"nobody likes frequent or mandatory updates with no noticeable change in the ""experience"", I just want to see my balance without constant interruptions like ""turn on fingerprints!"" or ""please take a moment to read our blah-blah-blah-blah...and now! you're trying very hard to make me ""turn on fingerprints!!"" why?? I don't want to - and I don't want to be told again and again every chance you get, many people are complaining about this stupid detail yet it remains and is more annoying every time",2025-01-30,1
The app STILL doesn't format correctly on Android 15 on a Pixel 9 Pro. The text on the menu at the bottom of the screen overlaps the icons. I sent an email to the address provided in the app support section and they were useless. Clearly didn't read the email and look at the screenshot of the problem with the app since they sent an canned response about requesting account information over email. The app itself isn't bad but customer service is worthless.,2025-01-11,1
"Every time I log in to see my balance I first have to click through the new features script, then the how to use them script, then post out of all those so I can see my balance. It is so infuriating. I have only found the Bill Pay edit page once and that was after 40 minutes of back and forth clicking. Data always being stolen from Chase, and them messing up automatic payments, I say next year - new bank.",2024-12-23,1
"Not a good company. They cut my limit on one of my cards in half and less than half on another because of balances on other cards. It doesn't matter that my payment history is exceptional and I have no late or missed payments. Total b.s! That's only going to further impact my score and may have a negative impact with other companies. As soon as I pay them off, I'm canceling all 3 cards. They'll never make another dimensions off me!!!",2025-01-25,1
"There's always something going on with this card. It's difficult to reconcile the balances. When I question the account, I'm being treated like a thief. I'm slowly transitioning to another card because this Amazon card is always a problem! Customer service doesn't seem to want to help. Amazon blames it on Chase. Chase blames It on Amazon. It's the most difficult card that I have. Purchases are labeled in da vinci-like codes! I can never understand my bill! My purchase history is unreadable!",2025-01-06,1
"Every time I open the app (for multiple years now) it asks for my fingerprint to login. A newly added dark pattern makes this more intrusive and difficult to avoid. A fingerprint or any other biometric is a username, not a password. You cannot (reasonably) change your biometrics. Chase Bank is encouraging poor security practice, opening you up to fraud and possible liability. And they made it annoying!",2025-01-25,1
I have to depend on the chase app because I moved and there are no Chase banks in my town. I was a big fan of the app right up until they demanded an update that does not work. I now can't use the app because it is locked up with the update demand. Now that I can not use the app for banking I'm guess I have to open an account with another bank that has locations in my city. It's a shame they make no allowance for users who can not get the update to work. I am now VERY UNHAPPY.,2025-04-22,1
"1 star for blocking screenshot. This prevents me from saving my own confirmation numbers and breaks my entire way of tracking all my bills. Because of this poor design decision, I have to do a less secure workaround of taking photos of the screen and texting it to myself. I might not keep my card if you don't fix it. Citi doesn't make it hard and waste my time just to pay my bill.",2025-02-07,1
"It is very stupid for Chase to only allow you to verify your account from the cell phone APP instead of the text message, and they only recognize 1 device. I changed my phone and they still sent the push message to my old phone. I had to call 2 times to get this changed to my new phone so that I can log in from my computer. For people without smart phone, they provide no solution.",2025-02-28,1
"The app is acceptable because it works. It's simple, I can pay my bills, the Zelle thing is fine, but I hate Chase. I avoid all banking with Chase wherever possible due to an awful experience I had with a local branch manager. If I could eliminate it, I would, but regretfully, this app has worked consistently for years.",2025-01-03,1
"Though they claim they sent a notice, there is nothing in my alerts nor has anything come by mail, they lowered by available credit by 10k even though I've never missed a payment on any credit card in the last 15 years, because they felt my overall credit usage was too high. My credit score was hit hard due this move and NOW my credit usage is too high and this also hit my credit score hard!",2025-01-24,1
"Does not open app when clicking links in Chase emails. Previous: Push notifications to authorize desktop logins from Firefox unabailable. So many clicks to do anything other than view balances. Why do you need to confirm every navigation action? I've already said I want to schedule a payment twice, you do not need to give me a popup to ask me a 3rd time. The product owner @ Chase is clearly not a user of the app.",2025-01-13,1
"I am a legally blind user, and the most recent iteration of this app has the font small enough that it is difficult for my fell-sighted wife to read it efficiently. You people seriously need to fix this, and you need to fix it right freaking now. Your font was small enough, and in some areas it was simply not big enough, but at least it was legible in most areas of the app. This is ridiculous! FIX IT!!!",2024-12-06,1
"Absolutely the worst app of its kind. Slow, cumbersome, recent redesign makes it impossible to find anything, important information does not load and then it times out or crashes. Using the website is infinitely easier than this dinosaur. Update: now the app has decided that I am never connected to my network. This really is a POS app.",2025-01-09,1
"One word: search. It does me almost no good to search using only transaction amounts. It's unbelievable to me that I can't search using the description. The web is the same way. The app does other things fine. It's not incredible, but it generally works. If you want to make it useful, let me search like a human being.",2025-01-08,1
"""I am very disappointed with Chase Bank. I used their credit card only one time to purchase an iPhone, and within just 12 hours, my credit score dropped by 25 points. As soon as I noticed, I immediately paid off the full balance and closed the card permanently. I trusted Chase to protect my credit health, but this experience was very frustrating. I would not recommend their credit cards to anyone who values their credit score and financial stability.After my bad experience i used discover credit",2025-04-25,1
"Is does not update, it does not show charges pending if you call and have a charge pending. It does not have any live agents. The app is not seamless. There are tons of issues that literally affect your credit, your financial situation - because it will cost you a lot if you think you can rely on this app at all to help manage your account. This has been by far the worst experience ever with any credit card company. I would never EVER recommend this to anyone. Ever",2025-01-27,1
"The worst bank, even when I don't use the app. Some of my accounts can not be accessed. Called them several times to correct the issues, but nobody knows how to fix it. This morning, I found out that I couldn't view my credit card account. This is very annoying. Chase Bank got some serious IT issues, among other things. They need a good shakeup at the top, IMO. Stay away.",2025-02-25,1
Tried to log on. Got a message to update app which I already did yesterday. Updated again. Message won't go away & it blocks my screen says I need OS 6.0 or higher. I'm a senior citizen & I don't know what that means. It worked beforeu even if it wasnt great but now I can't even log on. Why bother offering an app if u won't allow people to log on. Typical Chase BS as always. I'm uninstalling. Thanks for messing it up worse Chase. Get customer service. ðŸ˜ ,2025-01-17,1
"I've used the app for years with no problems, but within the past 6 months, the app has become SUPER GLITCHY. It seemed to be a steady decline. At first, it just wouldn't close when I finished banking. Then, it was delaying being able to see recent transactions. Today, I couldn't see my transactions at all. As soon as I would click anywhere on the home page, it would crash and log me out... What's going on Chase?",2024-07-08,1

"Used a Chase credit card for almost 30 years. The customer service has gone downhill so drastically that I found another credit card to use as my main card. I had trouble with a hotel returning my deposit even though I canceled within the timeframe.

Overall people who test websites for ease of use would give Chases website a low score because it takes way more than 2 mouse clicks to get to any content. I feel that I am pretty tech-savvy & I don't find it user-friendly whatsoever!

"Great app except... When paying my CC, it provides me ""Remaining Balance"" (not statement balance due), total amount on card, or minimum payment and other amount. To pay the statement balance you have to find it (not hard) and manually enter into the ""Other amount"". If I didn't know better I'd say Chase is trying to get me to pay something less than the statement balance so thy can tack on 15-20% interest on the remaining balance not paid because of the difficulty of discovering that amount.",2025-02-27,2
"Cannot edit recurring transfers from the app but you can set them up there. Terribly inconvenient. Added a star because the constant pop-up issue.

"It's almost a great app. It has a decent interface. The problem is that it's horribly made. It takes all of my phone's resources just to run, and even then it runs slowly and crashes.

In particular, the fact that the ""billing"" and ""closing"" dates are different makes the current balance number difficult to interpret.

"Great app except... When paying my CC, it provides me ""Remaining Balance"" (not statement balance due), total amount on card, or minimum payment and other amount. To pay the statement balance you have to find it (not hard) and manually enter into the ""Other amount"". If I didn't know better I'd say Chase is trying to get me to pay something less than the statement balance so thy can tack on 15-20% interest on the remaining balance not paid because of the difficulty of discovering that amount.",2025-02-27,3
"Cannot edit recurring transfers from the app but you can set them up there. Terribly inconvenient. Added a star because the constant pop-up issue.

To pay the statement balance you have to find it (not hard) and manually enter into the ""Other amount"". If I didn't know better I'd say Chase is trying to get me to pay something less than the statement balance so thy can tack on 15-20% interest on the remaining balance not paid because of the difficulty of discovering that amount.",2025-02-27,4
"Cannot edit recurring transfers from the app but you can set them up there. Terribly inconvenient. Added a star because the constant pop-up issue.

"I'm guessing all cards are like this but the interface is pretty obnoxious. In particular, the fact that the ""billing"" and ""closing"" dates are different makes the current balance number difficult to interpret.

"As a non-app person, I'd say this works fine. I prefer to use my computer once every 6 months or so. I do love having a debit card, it makes a person think twice before spending money because one has to make sure they have money BEFORE spending it. Whereas, with a credit card one can easily spend more than they can pay in a month!",2024-11-26,4
"Overall a good, solid, feature rich app. Since we use it for auto bill pay with utilities etc., we pay it every other week (payday) and after trips. It would be incredibly helpful if, after making a payment, it would show the balance at the time the payment was received. It would make it easier to track what the payment covered and what remains to be counted in the next payment cycle. Maybe changing a highlight or marking showing what entries are paid off at that time.",2024-10-25,4
"This app is modern and has all of the features you would expect from the biggest bank in the USA. However, it is really cluttered and has far too many pop-ups, reminders, etc. in my opinion. The interface needs to be simplified. If Discover, Amex, Cap One, Navy Fed, and several other smaller institutions can do it, certainly the app developers for Chase should be capable.",2024-06-01,4
"Unable to log in. It required password, text contact, biometric registration, and scanning one's driver's license, which is ridiculous since that's more than you'd need to launch a nuclear missile. It won't scan my driver's license after carefully composing the picture as requested, holding the phone as still as a sniper, and adjusting lighting for glare. I wasted nearly an hour trying to log in, then gave up. At this point I'd rather cancel my Chase account than jump through any more hoops.",2025-05-19,5

Even after I enter my password, have them call me with a code, and then have a picture of my driver's license scanned, it will never confirm I am me. I get the message for me to try again later, only for it to do the same routine. It only let me in when I first started using the app. The app would not let me update any information the few times it granted me access. Not worth the aggravation to use.",2025-05-20,5
Was a great app. It only works somewhat. only lets you look at your accounts. It killed fingerprint login and wont allow you to make any changes. You can see everything about your igsisting accounts but when you try to look or due anything else it tells you that it is unable to connect to Chase Bank and to try again later. Has been doing this for a couple of months. Makes one question how secure and safe it is. uninstalling for now. It raises to many questions to be safe.,2025-03-06,5

"Password reset every time. Chase is much less secure because their password requirements are so bizarre. Adding additional elements or characters risks triggering one of their automatic rejection criteria, and a longer password is less likely to pass their validity test.

The hotel acknowledged that I deserved a refund, and said they were trying to give me a refund, but there was some technical difficulty. After some time, I asked Chase to get my money back. They were snotty, and talked down t me as if I was a liar.",2025-03-06,5
"While it's better than other banking apps I've used, it's still fairly tricky to navigate the menu system and know where things are. Also, I regularly use Zelle and today it just stopped working. I can't send funds, the screen is blank. Restarting the app or my phone doesn't fix it. And recently I've had other issues with the Zelle integration not letting me edit contacts. It's just a poor setup, they need better designers.",2025-02-04,5
"This app is pretty clean and easy to use but, it doesn't show how balance before and and after transactions. I want to see my balance progession. I want to look at my transaction history and be able to easily track my progress. I recently made a payment and was expecting my balance to be a lot lower than it is. Looking at the transaction history isnt that helpful cuz it doesnt show my balance data for each transaction.",2025-02-17,5
Overall people who test websites for ease of use would give Chases website a low score because it takes way more than 2 mouse clicks to get to any content. I feel that I am pretty tech-savvy & I don't find it user-friendly whatsoever! And lastly with this most recent app update there's this new widget that pops up every time there's a transaction or notation on the account that I find annoying as all get out & I have found no way to disable it!,2025-02-12,5
"Great app except... When paying my CC, it provides me ""Remaining Balance"" (not statement balance due), total amount on card, or minimum payment and other amount. To pay the statement balance you have to find it (not hard) and manually enter into the ""Other amount"". If I didn't know better I'd say Chase is trying to get me to pay something less than the statement balance so thy can tack on 15-20% interest on the remaining balance not paid because of the difficulty of discovering that amount.",2025-02-27,5
"Cannot edit recurring transfers from the app but you can set them up there. Terribly inconvenient. Added a star because the constant pop-up issue. A pop-up at every login asking for updated income so they can send more offers, when I already receive weekly physical mailings. Uninterested, no way to opt out. Too many force pop-up screens, new 'features'.",2024-12-31,5
The required update is no longer compatible with my device!!!!# IT WANTS TO UPDATE as of 3/24/2025 AND suddenly my phone's not good enough! tells me to contact the developers of the app-- like that will helpðŸ˜¡ I am not going to buy a new Phone when this OS 11 is still supposed to be supported. Ot isherwise it was easy to use and WAS super quick for deposits.,2025-03-26,5
"The app is easy to use, and I love all of the tracking info it gives you, but trying to log In is a nightmare. For starters, the ""remember me"" button has NEVER worked, which I'm assuming is a client-side issue. Also, I've had to jump through hoops to change my password EVERY TIME I try to log in to the app. For whatever reason, the app never remembers my password, and I have list of a dozen or so passwords that have only worked one time after I reset them. Good app, but it's me-proof.",2025-02-03,5
"It's almost a great app. It has a decent interface. The problem is that it's horribly made. It takes all of my phone's resources just to run, and even then it runs slowly and crashes. They should also definitely have a running total for each transaction so that you can follow your money better. That's just basic in a modern banking app. Do better Chase.",2024-04-01,5
"I'm guessing all cards are like this but the interface is pretty obnoxious. In particular, the fact that the ""billing"" and ""closing"" dates are different makes the current balance number difficult to interpret. More often than not the feature I use the most is ""download transaction csv"" then figure things out with a spread sheet. I'm not sure what all the history or reasoning behind this design is, but frankly it's pretty annoying.",2024-09-30,5
"Mostly intuitive banking/credit card app. Easy to navigate. I absolutely HATE that they won't add in a running balance by transaction. Literally would be a 5* app if they added it in. Typical bank. Credit journey could be more informative; my number regularly fluctuates by 20-30 points but the explanations are always the same, but having the info on hand is good. Offers are ok. Haven't used the travel/points redemption area of the app yet.",2024-03-16,5
"I get a little overwhelmed by the services provided in app... I was a total skeptic for more than two years but now am really more interested in everything that Chase offers! It's all accessible right there in app. There was one instance that I had interest in an offer, a Chase associate called me right away and answered all my questions. However I am having a problem updating my new phone number to sync with Google Wallet. It wants to verify my identity by sending text to the old number.",2025-02-21,5
"For the love of all that is holy please introduce a dark mode and a bulk offers/automatic offers claim feature. It loads so slowly and it takes so much effort, plus the eye searing color scheme, that I rarely use the app or associated cards. Make it easier to use and we'll use it more. Otherwise, it's just a typical banking app designed by people who don't have design experience or use smartphones. The same you'd expect from Wells Fargo or any other major bank. It does what it needs to though.",2024-12-08,5
"Generally useful but super irritating and inefficient. They are hell bent on getting you to use fingerprint stuff, I get it but I'm using the password, from that screen I could switch to fingerprint easily but you still put a blocker up requiring me to click password then you ""remind"" me regularly to set up the fingerprint. I do not want that. Also when using the app the layout is constantly changing as they add ""reminders"" for other things I could easily do if I wanted to.",2025-04-25,5
"Quick access to accounts works great. Zelle works great. Ultimate rewards to book travel is a nightmare, won't load, takes forever, have to do that from the internet instead of app. Needs to be improved. Don't like the functionality of adding offers (the add button opens up the offer almost as a whole page so makes it challenging to add multiple offers quickly). The previous version was more user friendly.",2024-02-28,5
"This app was great at the beginning, but now recently it has been giving me trouble. I think it has a bug or something whenever you go to securities and setting check or change the notification or something and doesn't let you go back to the main screen, the whole app freezes and only thing you could do is close the app and reopen from start.",2024-07-27,5
"ðŸ˜­ I wanted to really like this app. I had everything set up just right, using it as my primary account that I could transfer funds into my other accounts & vice versa. And pay all my bills. Starting overnight, and on to today, 09/27/24, it is not showing my external accounts as linked. I can see them underneath, but the names and balances are no longer showing on the first screen. How did that happen? I do not want to keep sending micro payments back & forth. Did that already.ðŸ¤”",2024-09-27,5
"when I make a payment of say, 80$ it shows on the statement a different number. I do not like that AT ALL. I feel as if CHASE is screwing me with my pay offs. the emails shows the correct amount and the app numbers are way off. EVERY. TIME. And of coarse, chase shows a lower number payment. How did I pay my balance of 87.19 and the app shows 68.75? Sneaky and WRONG.I originally gave a 1 star but, I do not like the way their 'display' of payments and charges go, their customer service is GREAT",2025-05-16,5
"Works well on a Pixel 7. Has tons of features. Wish it was easier to see recurring payments in Zelle to edit them. But this app has basically EVERYTHING YOU NEED for your BANKING needs unless you're part of the very specific 1% that have very odd needs. It does NOT HAVE EVERYTHING FOR YOU4 FINANCIAL NEEDS. The budget setup is a joke since it relies on the charges accurately self reporting, doesn't allow you to set your own values. Credit score estimator is decent.",2024-12-27,5
"Easy to navigate, very functional. Searching for specific transactions is pretty substandard. They need a stronger search function. You can only search by date amount and transaction type. Finding an individual transaction in a thousand is going to take a lot of scrolling.",2025-01-21,5
"Great app. Does everything I need it to do. Only wish there was fingerprint scanner to access quicker. Overall great app. One issue with the UX, at the bottom of the app's main screen, the icons are overlapping each other. The issue goes with in landscape mode, but is broken in portrait. Not a deal breaker, but it takes away from the user experience.",2024-10-15,5
"It's a good app. Never any problems. The only thing I don't like is the tracker codes & keystroke monitors. I think monitoring is the correct word. Basically, they record your keystrokes when you're putting in your password.o Otherwise, it is a great app.",2025-03-27,5
"As a non-app person, I'd say this works fine. I prefer to use my computer once every 6 months or so. I do love having a debit card, it makes a person think twice before spending money because one has to make sure they have money BEFORE spending it. Whereas, with a credit card one can easily spend more than they can pay in a month!",2024-11-26,5
"Overall a good, solid, feature rich app. Since we use it for auto bill pay with utilities etc., we pay it every other week (payday) and after trips. It would be incredibly helpful if, after making a payment, it would show the balance at the time the payment was received. It would make it easier to track what the payment covered and what remains to be counted in the next payment cycle. Maybe changing a highlight or marking showing what entries are paid off at that time.",2024-10-25,5
"This app is modern and has all of the features you would expect from the biggest bank in the USA. However, it is really cluttered and has far too many pop-ups, reminders, etc. in my opinion. The interface needs to be simplified. If Discover, Amex, Cap One, Navy Fed, and several other smaller institutions can do it, certainly the app developers for Chase should be capable.",2024-06-01,5
"Honestly, it's a great app that let's me track spending, credit card and account balances, while also trading stocks (they even added fractional stock trading now)! Their credit score checking uses a sort of out of date scoring metric, but it's somewhat still accurate enough. As an app, it's a really great financial tool and doesn't really have any major bugs at all in my experience. Overall, very satisfied with using the app.",2024-10-28,5
"I lost my wallet and was in mini panic mode. Every card that gave me access to money was lost. Cherry on top....I have no cash on hand.....woof. Then your app reminded me that the cards can still be used if in my Google wallet....Holly hell. Adding them was so easy. Nice job. I have one suggestion. To make it even more user-friendly...offer an expedited option (for a fee) to the process for replacing a card. I feel so much better, but I would have paid a fee to get them sooner. ðŸ˜€",2025-05-16,5
"I have been using this app for a few years now and I like it alot. It makes it easy to manage my account,make payments,lock/unlock my cards and also shows me my credit score for free. The thing I like the most about it is that unlike almost every app today,Chase has no trackers in it. I despise apps with trackers that steal and sell your private info. The Chase app not having any trackers, along with the services it provides makes it a winner! Great app,highly recommended!",2025-03-26,5
"App is pretty straightforward. It's fast. It's pretty simple, and it has most everything you need from a banking app. I can do any basic banking, bill paying and credit card managing tasks. I'm happy with it. 2025-12-03 update... The newest version of the app is ok from a feature/ functionality standpoint. But, why did the font get reduced to extra tiny? Of all the apps I use on my phone, this app has the tiniest font of all of them. Please enlarge the font. It's tiny!",2025-01-03,5
"Great app. You can do everything you need to do with this app, such as: view your statements, transactions, payment history. You can pay your bill and set up auto pay if you'd like. You can view Chase offers. You can check your credit score and much more! And all of your Chase accounts are together in one app! The app is very easy to navigate/very user friendly. You can set up notifications for reminders about payment due dates and more. It's very convenient. A must have for all Chase customers!",2024-12-31,5
"Simple and very user friendly for the banking side. Chase resolved an issue I had regarding fraud. Easy very accommodating with the whole situation. Definitely recommend, the customer service was very understanding and friendly. Though I am not a fan of using the application for investment not that user friendly but the website is great. I would still recommend.",2025-01-04,5
"Absolute favorite app for credit cards. Made it super easy to search for specific transactions, being able to filter by type, keywords, etc. Also LOVE that it shows detailed breakdowns for the cashback rewards earned. I switched to the PayPal credit card for a while because they were offering better cash back rewards on everything except Amazon purchases, but the PayPal app is terrible and nowhere near as user feature rich.",2024-12-10,5
"Great app from a great bank ! Especially useful if you also have a Chase checking/savings account as you can ""do it all"" right from the app. Balance transfers + investing + using/tracking points + paying bills, etc, you can do it all with ease. I love that the app is streamlined and intuitive , charts for saving, + investment goals, too. Car loans or mortgages everything right at your fingertip. They somehow have the ""like family"" vibe despite their success!! Love em!",2025-03-03,5
"One of the things that keep me at Chase is this excellent mobile app. I can just easily manage everything with ease and I feel confident of all my payments, transactions and just overall management of my card with very little friction through this app. Highly recommend. Developers have done an outstanding job and it shows through the user experience and how it keeps improving",2025-01-31,5
Great tool for on the go banking. It literally makes managing your finances at the tip of your fingers so easy and convenient. Mobile quality just like sitting at my desktop. Nice financial tool. Mobile app still works like a charm they've actually improved a process that was already working very well in my opinion. Very user friendly with bugs and kinks pretty much non-existent. Appreciate the fact the technology team has done a great job with security of the app. Keep up the good work!,2024-12-25,5
"I love this card and how quickly the points can add up. When booking through Chase travel I never have a problem getting ahold of a representative and find that they take time with you and go the extra mile for you. Though it has a yearly fee, it also gives you well over that value with perks offered to card holders. The perks are very useful! Be sure to look over all of the numerous card holders benefits. It's well worth it.",2025-01-23,5
"It is a great app. You can do pretty much everything in the app so you don't have to call in. Two small things. Get rid of the fingerprint prompt. If I want to set that up, I will do it on my own. More importantly, if I can open a CD through the app, when the terms end, I should be able to modify and/or close it on my own without calling in or meeting with a banker. Outside that, it is a great app you keep building on.",2024-05-07,5
"Seamless Banking Experience! ""Iâ€™ve been using the Chase Mobile Banking app for years, and it never disappoints! It's user-friendly, fast, and secure, allowing me to check balances, transfer funds, pay bills, and deposit checks easily. The intuitive navigation makes finding what I need a breeze. Chaseâ€™s customer support is excellent, with helpful FAQs and direct access to assistance. Overall, the app has simplified my financial management and saved me time. Highly recommend!""",2024-10-28,5
"I can check my balance on all Chase accounts, pay bills, add payees, etc. It feels safe & secure too. Love the fingerprint login. Update: The app continues to be one of the best banking apps, IMO. They maintain a great layout and don't make constant changes just to change things. When something is perfect, why change it?",2024-10-25,5
"This application meets all of my requirements and provides an excellent user experience. However, there is one issue: while recurring payments can be set up, they cannot be modified or canceled within the app. To make such changes, one must contact Chase directly. Despite this inconvenience, the app excels in credit tracking, balance management, and rewards/ bonuses, making it one of the best banking applications available for Android.",2024-10-27,5
"I love the Chase app. I have it for my Amazon Visa Account. It shows me everything, and allows me to make one or more payments early before the due date. I like to pay it as the month goes by so I don't have such a large payment at the end of the month. I love being able to set up and forget about the automatic payment feature so that my payments are NEVER LATE! Everything is viewable on the app, including your credit score.",2025-04-23,5
"Not bad! I appreciate Chase trying to fix issues in their past services. I think digital is their ""forte"" (their branches suck). They have very much improved their site, and now provide great tools to help with credit-building and maintaining. Glad I stuck with them and will update to 5 stars shortly, as there are still minor tweaks they need to get to, but from recent past behavior, I don't think it will take them long to address. Good job, Chase (JP). Keep it up!",2024-11-06,5
"I've used the Chase Mobile App for almpst 3 yrs now and have had zero problems. I enjoy the real-time notifications, and I especially enjoy the ease of paying my bills online thru the app. Having all of my Chase accounts at my fingertips and being able to move funds from one account to another is simple, and the help option is very informative. Granted, speaking with an actual human being is always ideal, the app offers a quick 1st step toward all my banking needs!",2024-04-13,5
"I have nothing but great thing to say about this Chase App. As someone who is very reluctant to ""going digital"", I am always wary of things like this. But I was pleasantly surprised! When I realized how easy it is to do a ton of different financial things in the app, I was hooked. Not to mention, my whole family has banked with them for decades. If you are up in the air, wondering if this app, or even banking at Chase altogether, is worth it... I can honestly and truly say - yes it is.",2024-05-24,5
