"Almost every time I try and use the app, it won't let me sign in. Even after I enter my password, have them call me with a code, and then have a picture of my driver's license scanned, it will never confirm I am me. I get the message for me to try again later, only for it to do the same routine. It only let me in when I first started using the app. The app would not let me update any information the few times it granted me access. Not worth the aggravation to use.",2025-05-20,1

"Unable to log in. It required password, text contact, biometric registration, and scanning one's driver's license, which is ridiculous since that's more than you'd need to launch a nuclear missile. It won't scan my driver's license after carefully composing the picture as requested, holding the phone as still as a sniper, and adjusting lighting for glare. I wasted nearly an hour trying to log in, then gave up. At this point I'd rather cancel my Chase account than jump through any more hoops.",2025-05-19,1

"Password reset every time. Chase is much less secure because their password requirements are so bizarre. Adding additional elements or characters risks triggering one of their automatic rejection criteria, and a longer password is less likely to pass their validity test. It's worrisome that they are so out of date on best practices protocol. They're essentially forcing use of a third party password manager or making us write them down.",2025-05-15,1

Stop changing your stupid app. Its a banking app it doesnt need to look pretty. It needs to function. Stop changing where i need to go to do my usual functions. Leave the UI alone. Add features as needed but the recent change literally made it more difficult and take more steps to do what i previously did with 1 click. What was the purpose?

Chase continues to send me credit cards in the USPS that I did not order nor am I notified I would be getting them. I have been trying to discuss this with anyone from the Corporate Office but have only been sent form letters defending their actions. I have locked my credit cards with this company and will not be using them any longer because clearly they do not have my best interest in mind.

Fully processed recent transactions are not being listed in order by date. Causing unnecessary confusion. Trying to perform transfers to credit unions they have you sign in with fails because their programmers don't want to accomodate member IDs along side account and routing numbers as is required for the transfers to process successfully. In otherwords Chase can receive money from credit unions just fine... just makes it impossible to transfer back through the app. GUI failings for buttons?,2025-03-17,2

Fully processed recent transactions are not being listed in order by date. Causing unnecessary confusion. Trying to perform transfers to credit unions they have you sign in with fails because their programmers don't want to accomodate member IDs along side account and routing numbers as is required for the transfers to process successfully. In otherwords Chase can receive money from credit unions just fine... just makes it impossible to transfer back through the app. GUI failings for buttons?,2025-03-17,3

Using the travel booking is a menace. You won't necessarily get the airline you booked on. If the price is low you're on and overbook flight. Chase travel does not seem to be connected at all to the Chase card except for It's ability to charge you. There is a 3% transaction fee on anything besides US dollars.

Fully processed recent transactions are not being listed in order by date. Causing unnecessary confusion.

I feel that I am pretty tech-savvy & I don't find it user-friendly whatsoever! And lastly with this most recent app update there's this new widget that pops up every time there's a transaction or notation on the account that I find annoying as all get out & I have found no way to disable it!,2025-02-12,4

For starters, the ""remember me"" button has NEVER worked, which I'm assuming is a client-side issue. Also, I've had to jump through hoops to change my password EVERY TIME I try to log in to the app. For whatever reason, the app never remembers my password, and I have list of a dozen or so passwords that have only worked one time after I reset them.

It loads so slowly and it takes so much effort, plus the eye searing color scheme, that I rarely use the app or associated cards. Make it easier to use and we'll use it more.

Since this is very persistent on asking for a review and I'm not having any luck with it right now this is your review. Do not get Chase Disney because there are so many fees. currently I'm getting cash advance fees for some reason on venmo purchases and if that's not enough I'm also getting interest fees on the cash advances that I did not make. This is recent. I've used this account plenty of times with venmo before without any problems. Now it charges $10 each time+interest,2024-12-02,4

"I have seen the change in the app slightly. Hopefully, it can be adjusted back to the way it was. Whenever the app is open and switching to another app, it would blank out the Chase screen.

Card don't give me access to go inside to the ready teller machines when you do the walk up instead of the drive thru. Other than that, I don't have any issues with Chase.",2024-10-28,4

Sometimes the app takes to long to load,2024-10-28,4
Given the one-star rating rating almost exclusively because of the inability to take a screen shot. Unnecessary security function prevents the ability to quickly save confirmation numbers given to verify transactions. Nothing 'mobile' about having to search for a pen to then copy down some infinite-digit number. Security features should be sensible.,2024-10-28,4

"Update: they are getting heavier with ads. Asking if I want to ""pay over time"" for a credit card charge-- how useless is that? Isn't that what credit cards are for?

The app is very user friendly but I recently found out that you have to pay back the money you use from their credit cards. I spent a few thousand but after about a month they sent me bill asking to pay them back so I guess I was just borrowing that money which is less enticing.

"The app has been bug free and pretty easy to use for ages. I do prefer how the interface looked pre-2024, it had more blue which gave it character. The whiteout themeing looks bland and makes UI elements blend in too much. I also dislike the additional, redudant login screen that asks whether I want to use fingerprint or password. The main login screen with my username already allows both options, that should be the default screen on launch (which is how it used to be).",2025-03-10,4

It's good but the search option is terrible. Why search by name isn't an option. You have a search/filter but you can only filter and not do an actual search. It makes it difficult to narrow down the transactions being looked for. Please add the ability to do so. Thanks,2025-02-14,4
It should be easier to reset a password. Since I use finger print feature. It is hard to remember so many passwords. It is a nightmare for us account holders. For real . Overall your IT doescan amazing work. Congrats,2025-02-13,4

Drains battery quickly when open. Benefits could be displayed more clearly. Freedom unlimited card and auto loan is good. App fictions well dispite battery drain.,2025-02-01,4
The dates of recent transactions are confusing when most days only have one transaction. The bold bar/line that goes across the page below the date seems to separate the date from the transaction that it goes with.

Fully processed recent transactions are not being listed in order by date. Causing unnecessary confusion. Trying to perform transfers to credit unions they have you sign in with fails because their programmers don't want to accomodate member IDs along side account and routing numbers as is required for the transfers to process successfully. In otherwords Chase can receive money from credit unions just fine... just makes it impossible to transfer back through the app. GUI failings for buttons?,2025-03-17,5

Using the travel booking is a menace. You won't necessarily get the airline you booked on. If the price is low you're on and overbook flight. Chase travel does not seem to be connected at all to the Chase card except for It's ability to charge you. There is a 3% transaction fee on anything besides US dollars.

Great and convenient for many MANY things but not being able to search your personal checking/savings transactions via merchant name yet having that option for lines of credit make me feel like Chase cares more how you spend THEIR money compared to your own.

Your CS rep insists it wasn't possible & I have to wait one day. I'm not a happy customer this time. Something that's worked perfectly for months is no longer working. I got the same info from the CS rep - one day to wait. Regardless of what's happened in the past.,2024-11-25,5
To many frequent changes. gets annoying after you just refigured out. How to navigate a new update after you just figured out the last update,2024-11-23,5

"Tried to use my credit card and it declined sale. Got a email that said the card was ""locked"" but I checked in the app and it was not ""locked"". Very embarrassing!",2024-11-21,5
It was ok. Do not like doing things like this on phone,2024-11-20,5
Updates take up too much space. Hate it,2024-11-20,5
The app needs updating MORE often than others which becomes a hassle for on-the-go customers.,2024-11-20,5
Always needs an update I had to delete allot of apps too keep this,2024-11-20,5
Earlier today my car was locked but clearly my money was still getting spent. But I found out before I got too far,2024-11-20,5

"Look there is a lot about this app that is decent, but good Lord the entire point of it seems to be to upsell you on their other BS.

You need to stop asking if I want to use my fingerprint every time. I don't,2024-11-06,5
"I don't usually get too picky about design, but a search field that opens a second screen when tapped is really confusing and bad UX. Especially since the second search field that does what that was supposed to do isn't active, so not only am I disoriented by a search field opening a screen, but I have to tap twice to actually search. This is a cognitive challenge and might mess with your blind and low-vision users unfairly, too.",2024-11-04,5
I didn't know if deposit is ok or failed after deposit activity,2024-11-04,5
Verification notification not showing up,2024-11-03,5
I hate when I can't unlock my car when it's a problem with the Chase app and when you are trying to make a purchase it is in big inconvenience when your car isn't unlocking and you can't make a purchase at the grocery store or anywhere else and you shocked and have big groceries or whatever the situation is and now you're at the register trying to make a payment but now your car won't unlock because sometimes it's a problem with the Chase app they'll say this part of the system isn't working,2024-11-03,5
"Constant, unending popups. It's like being blasted with advertisements constantly, so much that I genuinely hate using this app and will use the desktop version with AdBlock Origin trained to disable all their garbage ""suggestions"". Can't even get through 5 screens without 4 ads popping up and insisting you read and decide on them RIGHT NOW. At least the app works perfectly, in exchange for some corpo feeling confident they're extracting as much value from you as possible.",2024-11-01,5
Terrible security features. This app allows your username to be saved into swipe-to-text suggestions.,2024-11-01,5

Annoying A F. Average at best. Does what u need but is a shopping mall of advertisements that are always in ur face and have no benefit to u. Not to mention it asks repeatedly are u sure u want to send Zelle payments????,2024-10-29,5
Good but bad at describing things,2024-10-29,5
Not bad,2024-10-28,5
"I have seen the change in the app slightly. Hopefully, it can be adjusted back to the way it was. Whenever the app is open and switching to another app, it would blank out the Chase screen. This would hide any information that was on the screen until the app is fully opened again. Now l, whenever that action is performed, it still shows all of my banking information. I would like it if it could be blank out again. Thank you",2024-10-28,5

"Only real issue I have had since joining with Chase is there has been a few times when I went to the ATM, it was not available to make a withdrawal when at the time I really needed to do so. Sometimes the machine didn't work, could not put my card in, could not read the screen. Very annoying. Card don't give me access to go inside to the ready teller machines when you do the walk up instead of the drive thru. Other than that, I don't have any issues with Chase.",2024-10-28,5
This app doesn't let one edit payees in bill pay. I've called Chase twice with no results to fix this issue.,2024-10-28,5
"When I first used the Chase app It was always on point, but lately It always has me in the negative. The app never allowed me to go in the negative. Now, every week, I'm in the negative. I am not happy with this app.",2024-10-28,5
Sometimes the app takes to long to load,2024-10-28,5
Given the one-star rating rating almost exclusively because of the inability to take a screen shot. Unnecessary security function prevents the ability to quickly save confirmation numbers given to verify transactions. Nothing 'mobile' about having to search for a pen to then copy down some infinite-digit number. Security features should be sensible.,2024-10-28,5
Atm is always down the one inside is full if you go to other atm they will charge you a fee that's wrong chase,2024-10-28,5
"Update: they are getting heavier with ads. Asking if I want to ""pay over time"" for a credit card charge-- how useless is that? Isn't that what credit cards are for? Instead of interest, you pay a fee. Innovative AND needy! Has begged for a review 5 times in the past 2 days. Previous review: They keep making it more and more capable. Almost anything you can do from PC, you can do here. Helpful for the occasional due-today bill that you forgot to pay yesterday.",2024-10-27,5

"when I make a payment of say, 80$ it shows on the statement a different number. I do not like that AT ALL. I feel as if CHASE is screwing me with my pay offs. the emails shows the correct amount and the app numbers are way off. EVERY. TIME. And of coarse, chase shows a lower number payment. How did I pay my balance of 87.19 and the app shows 68.75? Sneaky and WRONG.I originally gave a 1 star but, I do not like the way their 'display' of payments and charges go, their customer service is GREAT",2025-05-16,5

The app is very user friendly but I recently found out that you have to pay back the money you use from their credit cards. I spent a few thousand but after about a month they sent me bill asking to pay them back so I guess I was just borrowing that money which is less enticing. I called Chase to dispute it but they said just because someone is named Chase doesnt mean they have anything to do with the bank and he doesn't know anything about my finances and to stop calling him,2025-03-31,5

The main login screen with my username already allows both options, that should be the default screen on launch (which is how it used to be).",2025-03-10,5

"Solid app overall, though the ""pay card"" path has too many clicks and should be streamlined. I would prefer a ""pay all cards now"" button so I can avoid repeating extra steps",2025-02-17,5
"Sometimes the app freezes and I can't update my preferences, otherwise it's very easy and accessible.",2025-02-15,5
Good,2025-02-14,5
This is a powerful app that makes it easy to pay on my credit card.,2025-02-14,5
It's good but the search option is terrible. Why search by name isn't an option. You have a search/filter but you can only filter and not do an actual search. It makes it difficult to narrow down the transactions being looked for. Please add the ability to do so. Thanks,2025-02-14,5
It should be easier to reset a password. Since I use finger print feature. It is hard to remember so many passwords. It is a nightmare for us account holders. For real . Overall your IT doescan amazing work. Congrats,2025-02-13,5
It works but I have a feeling something is missing,2025-02-11,5
"Chase bank has been so wonderful with me. Very helpful when my husband passed, was on top of all that I needed to do to close out his account. Now they are helping me open my own account. Every staff member. Bank teller, managers ECT... Was just a blessing. Thank you Chase Bank",2025-02-11,5
works well overall.,2025-02-10,5
"app works fine other than the fact I can't search for past transactions using keywords like other banking apps, instead, you have to search using the date of the transaction,plus, the amount that you're looking for, other banks like BOA, just need search queries like ""Amazon"" and all of my transactions from Amazon will be front and center, not revolutionary tech we're talking about",2025-02-09,5
Excellent,2025-02-06,5
"App used to crash when I would select an account to view, but not anymore (knock on wood), so thats good at least.",2025-02-05,5
The app is alright. My only problems are.. that it is very hard to get a hold of the bank itself and I can't complain about purchases right there on the app to stop them from taking money out of my account,2025-02-04,5
it's very convenient but sometimes limits deposit and paying methods,2025-02-03,5
Good acceptance and timely precessing,2025-02-02,5
This is my first time..let's see how it goes,2025-02-02,5
"Update 2025:(seems 2 be fine so far)‚ò∫ I do not understand why I have to update so often! Very convenient.but since update, ALERTS ARE NOT WORKING! I recently updated today.yesterday alerts were working fine. Update:""alerts"" issue has been fixed. Update as of September 9th 2019, alerts function is not working again. You can log onto the app & click on the alert section & it'll say u hv a num. of alerts so when you try to check the alerts it will state that you have none? Alerts number still there",2025-02-02,5
Drains battery quickly when open. Benefits could be displayed more clearly. Freedom unlimited card and auto loan is good. App fictions well dispite battery drain.,2025-02-01,5
The dates of recent transactions are confusing when most days only have one transaction. The bold bar/line that goes across the page below the date seems to separate the date from the transaction that it goes with. It should have the date with that date's transactions both between the bold lines instead of the bold line separating them.,2025-01-30,5
Easy to use,2025-01-29,5
Some time it don't let u on it,2025-01-28,5

It is very easy to use.,2025-01-22,5
Functional and easy to use,2025-01-22,5
"Easy to navigate, very functional. Searching for specific transactions is pretty substandard. They need a stronger search function. You can only search by date amount and transaction type. Finding an individual transaction in a thousand is going to take a lot of scrolling.",2025-01-21,5
The app works well and is easy to use. One of my other banking apps has a feature to be able to enter future transactions for budgeting purposes. Something like that would change my rating to 5 stars,2025-01-21,5
"If I just want to manage my money (both in and out of Chase), it can be a bit confusing in how to get there. I would like to be able to do the same budgeting I did with Mint (setting categories, personalized breakdowns) and options to share information with my partner (we have shared Chase credit cards yet the main user has all the information). It would be great to share what we want to share without limitations, but still have security and peace of mind that the data is safe.",2025-01-21,5

It's so convenient. I absolutely love it.,2025-01-15,5
the alerts and tracking the transactions on your account is wonderful. It is easy to dispute a charge or request a refund. I would give it 5 stars if you could add additional spending categories such as Pet spending but the app won't allow you add.,2025-01-14,5
Check deposit works great! Wish they had more search options for transactions.,2025-01-14,5

Banking online is a lifesaver. I need Chase to make the print larger. It is a bit difficult to read. The only hitch is juggling payments when the due date occurs over a weekend. Sine it is automated that should run smoothly through the whole week,2025-01-07,5
Good app.... but wish the pic load piece worked with zelle QR code.,2025-01-07,5

Very detailed app organization could be a little better,2025-01-02,5
"The Chase App has a surprising amount of features available from Chase. At the time of this review each option seems easy to navigate and works well with a minimum of irritation. Overall, compared to other financial institutions apps it is far better designed, laid out, and easier to use. I'm leaving off a star because I wish I could edit the things that show on the main page after log in. Then I could tailor it to only show the things I use most right when I open the app.",2025-01-02,5

Needed several attempts to verify I'd. Very hard if phone is compromised - got a low line Android to help after iPhone with all apps froze. Please consider alternate option for verification.

But this app has basically EVERYTHING YOU NEED for your BANKING needs unless you're part of the very specific 1% that have very odd needs. It does NOT HAVE EVERYTHING FOR YOU4 FINANCIAL NEEDS. The budget setup is a joke since it relies on the charges accurately self reporting, doesn't allow you to set your own values. Credit score estimator is decent.",2024-12-27,5
Great app but on the latest version of Android the bottom navbar is smashed down.,2024-12-27,5
"I'm not 100 % satisfied!! There's this snapshot feature that by it's very definition is not accurate! I was actually told that they have it that way bcuz sometimes the seller will add an extra fee to the purchase after the purchase! Ya, I mentioned to the bank they should get rid of it ! They also said it's an estimate and they can round it up making the amount actually larger! Interesting how my checking balance became more accurate after I mentioned it to them! It's very suspicious!",2024-12-26,5
