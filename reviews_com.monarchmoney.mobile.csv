looks like it could be a good app but I can't add my bank account. its multiple hoops to connect it only for an email to not give me the link after redoing it all and trying to multiple times,2025-06-12,1
"any app that makes you create an account before explaining you have to pay to access it, is cheap.",2025-06-10,1
"Yet another app that requests all of your personal information, makes you sign up for an account, and then hits you with the ""So, here's our payment/subscription plan..."" jist. And you can bet your bottom dollar (ones I won't be giving to an app designed to help me track and maintain said dollars) that they sell off that personal information, regardless of if you choose to use their services or not. Would sure be nice if Google started LISTING THESE AS PAID APPS AND NOT FREE AT ALL!",2025-06-10,1
"Downloaded, signed up, immediately hit with a paywall/free trial, uninstalled it after that. If you can't offer a free tier with just the basics so we can get a feel for the app and what it has to offer as well as putting in banking info, you are no good. Look elsewhere.",2025-06-04,1
imagine paying monry to have an app tell you how much money you have,2025-06-03,1
it would be great if it would give you pricing options before requiring you to sign up. how does that make sense?,2025-06-02,1
have to pay for an app when I budget for free on a speesdsheet,2025-06-02,1
"I did a search for free budgeting app to help my son out with his bills. I got this. An app that stole my sign in information (email), by presenting itself as ""free"", and then it wanted to charge me $100.00 per year. Pathetic marketing, pathetic app, I won't be using this even if it became free. I cannot stand bait and switch apps.",2025-06-02,1
"Not a free app, false advertising",2025-06-01,1
They grab your information first before being forced to start a free trial. Can't even use the app without subscribing.,2025-05-30,1
pay to use the app when it's about saving,2025-05-30,1
"If your thinking about using this app but uncertain I would say try to find info online. The first thing you see when you open up is a required login. The second thing, is a pay wall. Then the third thing, is the main UI with a blocking popup saying connect credit cards. You are not allowed to interact with anything until you've fully committed to it. I downloaded the app with the intention of seeing what the features/UI are like before connecting my many banks. But apparently its not allowed.",2025-05-29,1
Frequent disconnection issues,2025-05-26,1
"Barely got started, then the ""start free trial"" announcement. I like free apps, and I don't just mean it's free to download.",2025-05-21,1
"doesn't allow me to use it for free, mint was better.",2025-05-21,1
unable to connect to Pennymac,2025-05-20,1
"Immediately requires monthly charge. how are we supposed to have a budget app to budget that costs so much? Developer responded: we save you money to pay for the subscription! lol. when we dont have enough money to get food but somehow they think their app will magically generate money. this app is for upper middle class, just say that.",2025-05-20,1
"App states it has a 7 day free trial then the moment I tap ""Start 7 day trial"" I get an email that I've been charged for their subscription. At best a mistake at worst intentionally misleading customers.",2025-05-19,1
why do you need to share my data with a third party? that is weird and creepy,2025-05-18,1
Too expensive unless you pay for a whole year. Also I don't want to be forced to use Google Play for subscriptions.,2025-05-17,1
"Update:Be advised that if you travel abroad/have foreign transactions, they will appear in Monarch incorrectly. 3600 ARS is approx. $4 US dollars, but my transactions report as $3600 US dollars. There's not even a feature to manually correct individual transactions like this. The inability to correctly interpret other currencies renders this service useless for me. I contacted Monarch & was told the fix is to not link accounts with these transactions, which defeats the purpose of their service.",2025-05-14,1
only 7 day trial. no thanks,2025-05-12,1
"I did the entire setup just to find out that it's only free for 7 days... I'm sure your app is worth the money, but I wish I'd known from the beginning before taking the time to create a profile. If I had the money to spend each month, then I probably wouldn't need your app.",2025-05-11,1
"honestly better then all the others. 5 stars for widgets!!! Changed to 1 star for lack of android widgets. Loyal android users have been asking for widgets for years while Apple users enjoy their's. It's been at least 3 years now, c'mon guys.",2025-05-10,1
does not let you pass by purchase page until you buy subscription,2025-05-08,1
"I cant find how to cancel my subscription. Monarch moneybis a scam. it won't let you unsubscribe once you're subscribed, you're locked in forever. DO NOT SUBSCRIBE!!!",2025-05-07,1
"Horrible, definitely not user-friendly uninstalled right away",2025-05-07,1
forced updates for no reason :) putting a modal up because you want me to update is anti-user. I'll update when I feel like it.,2025-05-05,1
Purchased a subscription and then the app broke its account provider with my bank. Save your money. Update: I decided to give Monarch a second chance after posting the review. I've experienced frequent and lengthy outages since then and their support has been completely unable to provide any useful assistance. They appear to serve mostly as gatekeepers requiring the user to jump through a long list of hoops before acknowledging the legitimacy of the request. I will be taking the refund.,2025-05-01,1
coming here because your app wont let me select what i need to in order to get the help im looking for. Its not letting choose the institution im having issues with either. I have tried 3 times to add my account and it says that its connected but when it takes me to the app it says i need to connect my account. If it connected my account and didnt have it in the app then WHERE DID MY INFORMATION GO?!?!?!?!?!?!?!,2025-05-01,1
Won't sync with Scotiabank,2025-04-25,1
"Recurring transactions is insanely dumb. How can I not mark a transaction as recurring but have to do it manually for every recurring transaction by knowing the exact amount and name of the merchant and date, not to mention it doesn't pick up any pattern whatsoever. An Excel Spreadsheet that cost over 100$.",2025-04-16,1
no free option.,2025-04-10,1
Very expensive,2025-04-10,1
Don't bother! You have to pay!,2025-04-09,1
doesn't allow Multicurrency.,2025-04-08,1
"Monarch worked good at first, but now so many transactions show up, but then completely dissappear. This app works to look at your accounts, but you can't budget until they fix all the problems",2025-04-07,1
Can't use unless you BUY the subscription,2025-04-06,1
You can't use it. There's an expensive paywall. :/,2025-04-05,1
"Worst experience ever! I will create my own budget categories, why ask me if it looks good but don't give me an option to say HELL NO. I know what I want in ny budget and it's not what you feel like giving me.",2025-04-04,1
what they don't mention is that its not a free app. force you for a trial after getting your login data then $15 a month!,2025-04-01,1
should clarify that app have no free option,2025-03-30,1
says it's free but it's really not,2025-03-30,1
"They make you create an account, by having you give them all your information, all before revealing that it isn't a free service. Despicable! You have to pay to use this sly, crooked app",2025-03-25,1
"This app is well designed and very functional, however, they tried to charge me $99 before my trial was even over and I still have yet to be able to cancel it. Contacted customer support with no reply after the AI said it couldn't assist in that problem.",2025-03-23,1
"It worked for a while, and when it did it was great. HOWEVER, now I can't connect properly with my accounts, and the app won't update.... In working with customer service, they are of no help. They are not addressing the actual issue, but instead are asking for screenshots of all transactions not coming through from my bank accounts. If they could fix the connection, that would fix the whole issue, but they are putting all that work on me when I'm the paying customer.",2025-03-21,1
Advertise your pricing before taking my data. A payment plan shouldn't be chosen after providing my PII.,2025-03-12,1
Scam,2025-03-11,1
Forces you to sign up for an account only to block all content behind a paywall. You have no choice but to start a 7 day free trial that will lead to a monthly subscription immediately after signing up for an account. Thanks for wasting my time. Now I'm going to get a bunch of spam emails because I can't get past the paywall to delete my account. 🙄,2025-03-10,1
Half the institutes aren't connecting. The ones that do connect don't show the right amount of money. (Off by hundreds) They are lacking the Bitcoin sites l wanted to connect. ( I didn't expect them to have it to begin with) If u add the feature I wanna be able to use it. And other minor infringements I find annoying.,2025-03-10,1
"Not worth paying. So many glitches. Constantly loses connections and instead of fixing them, you are forced to delete everything you did and reconnect the account. No big deal to them because you are expected to manually create rules. Support is terribly slow and useless. Every existing retail could be added to their data in minutes so it would know that Michael's is shopping and categorize it properly, but they don't. We are currently paying while teaching a bad program basic data. Never again.",2025-03-06,1
the connectivity issues are ongoing and hard to fix even for normal accounts,2025-03-05,1
After some changes recently connections with major banks require reauthorization every day. The support team refuses to admit that something changed and gives generic canned responses. Essentially this app has no relationship with most of the institutions to which it claims it can connect and any change can result in permanent or temporary loss of connection that will both potentially require hours of manual work from you to fix.,2025-03-04,1
Expensive af,2025-02-27,1
"They intentionally make it difficult to cancel a subscription. I had to answer a series of questions related to my reasons for cancelling. The last step was a box labled something along the lines of ""tell us more"". I didn't have anything more to say but I wasn't able to submit my ticket. When I typed something in the box, nothing appeared. I finally figured out the text in the box does not appear until you hit submit. IMO, this is intentional and therefore completely unethical.",2025-02-27,1
"Got it to get rid of my subscriptions, just for it to have another subscription itself. Stop trying make a quick cash grab and make a app that does what it says maybe then u might get better reviews",2025-02-25,1
"Forgot to cancel my trial and got charged for a year. Somewhat ironic for an app that advertises itself from keeping you from doing this. So far this app has cost me about $100 with no benefits above what Mint (which was free) gave me. It also can't sync with my student loans or my car loan, so I can't even see my full financial picture. Not impressed.",2025-02-24,1
I started the free week trial and the app would not connect to my TD or CIBC account.,2025-02-24,1
"I love installing a ""free"" app just to get hit with a subscription immediately after downloading with no option for a free version. Misleading asf.",2025-02-23,1

"Title: CSV Import Bug – ""Account Name"" Expects a Number Message: Bug in Monarch Money (v2.0.14) when importing the official CSV file provided by Monarch Money. The app rejects it, saying ""Account Name"" must be a number, though it should accept text (e.g., ""Checking Account""). Tested on MacBook Pro (latest macOS) in Google Chrome. This prevents importing even the provided sample file. Please fix this issue",2025-02-16,1
"I've been using this app for months and have enjoyed it. However, it now refuses to run on my phone as of today, 2/11/25. The website works, but the app doesn't. I cleared the cache and it didn't help. It fails at login and tells me, ""Something went wrong. Please try again later.""",2025-02-11,1
"If this app costs money, say so instead of hiding behind a ""7 day free trial"". It takes a full month to see if a budgeting app is working, not 7 days. It will take that long just to get it set up properly. This might be a great app, but I have been burned by so many others, where they don't work with 2 factor authentication or something else. I am not going to spend money or rush through 7 days testing this app.",2025-02-04,1
"new UI is so flat.. the contrast between the light grey and white is so faint. same in dark mode. preferred the contrast of the old UI. provided better separation between the cards, making the information easier on the eyes. accounts do not sync properly... refresh all used to give me the latest numbers and now it'll say 10hrs ago, 17hrs ago... a lot of these issues make it not worth the price.",2025-02-04,1
NOT FREE. AT ALL. 1. Install app 2. Sign in- Google account or Apple 3. Immediately get screen to start 7 day trial for $100 yearly subscription. No X or option to use any FREE version at all.,2025-02-04,1
I had to confirm 4 times that I wanted to cancel my subscription,2025-02-03,1
"Not worth $100.00 (nor the $50 discount i got), you still have to go through 90% of your statements, and edit them. doent have a live update of financial statements, and you have to wait 3-4 days to sync. Then re-sync, it every 3 days. Then i get an email that says, ""Account disconnected. Reconnect to keep your balances and transactions up to date."" It's like you pay to work. It does look nice. 😅",2025-01-30,1
Requires monthly payment. Not free.,2025-01-29,1
"Terrible at syncing with Canadian banks, especially Tangerine. At least their website is transparent at letting the public know what % of success they have at syncing with Canadian banks. Unfortunately, there is only a 12% success rate with Tangerine. Absolutely fed up that I paid for a yearly plan and now cannot sync. I can try 20 times in a row and it just syncs when it wants to. The app goes multiple days without syncing. Skip this app if you were looking for a syncing feature",2025-01-29,1
"$100? Nah. Half that and I'd actually pay it. Your not going to save me $100 I just want to track my finances. Too bad, its a good app. Way overpriced though. What is this Netflix.",2025-01-28,1
"POS money grab. Never even used it and they charged me 16 USD. Can't stand opportunistic companies like this. Asked for a refund, and they said: ""We received your refund request of $16.23 for Monthly Subscription (Monarch: Budget & Track Money), Transaction ID GPA.-51744..0, but this purchase doesn't meet with our policy. We understand that this must be frustrating and apologize for any inconvenience caused.""",2025-01-27,1
"Wasn't able to connect accounts from Fidelity, Mass Mutual, and BofA after repeated attempts. Not worth the trouble to set this up.",2025-01-25,1
"The service itself is good, the Android app - much less so. It's bogus and no matter how many times you report these bugs - they don't fix them, months and years later all of them are still in there. The new primitive datetime picker is horrible. It was the worst part of the UX in Mint and now it is of Monarch.",2025-01-24,1
Constantly dropping connections with my banks. Problems that I didn't ever have with Mint. I really like this app but these problems make using this app pointless. My net worth and spending are thousands of dollars off of reality because it won't sync my transactions correctly. And with the newest update transactions are constantly being recategorized making it extremely difficult to keep track of my budget.,2025-01-22,1
PWA (desktop app) constantly tries to access my microphone!?! Even though that permission isn't enąbled nor found on the Google store apk. Not sure what that's about but something is fishy. Oh yeah plus spending $100 on a buggy bad at math budgeting app is asanine.,2025-01-19,1

"Paid for service is fine, but I don't want to find out about it after you had me create an account and start telling you about me. You may not keep my data. Even worse, I can't get to settings to deactivate account without paying. I am stuck at a pay wall.",2025-01-16,1
Dissapointing 👎👎👎 App charges $99.99 a year. I'm better off just doing what I'm doing now using my calendar,2025-01-08,1
Not actually free,2025-01-05,1
Subscription trial heads up NOT FREE,2025-01-04,1
"Couldn't figure out how to sign up for the free trial. It let me create an account and sent a code to my email, but when I tried to sign up for the trial it kept asking me for my ""password"" and kept rejecting the password I just created and typed in, which I'm sure is correct. But it wouldn't take it.",2025-01-03,1
"One star because it's a ""free"" app until you download it and see that it actually requires a subscription. This deceptive marketing needs to stop.",2025-01-02,1
Every app that forces you to update and inconvenience you when your trying to do something gets a one star from me,2024-12-31,1
"It *was* an ok replacement for Mint, but now it's useless. Most of our accounts stopped syncing 1.5 months ago (same bank). When we tried to reconnect, we received an error stating support had been informed. Nope. I then submitted a ticket to support. Responses have been dismal to none - days go by w/no contact. Support tried to fix it at one point & ended up breaking the connection even worse! We have a 12 month subscription & we can't even use it. Complete waste of $ for us at this point.",2024-12-24,1
Found I was able to track and keep up with expenses faster myself than this app could it also could not properly calculate expenses to budget as trying to do so made it only calculate expenses and not income so therefore I am highly unsatisfied with the app and will proceed with doing my own budgeting/expenses,2024-12-24,1

"Can't even use the app because my subscription ended and it won't allow me to resubscribe. It tells me I have a subscription (which I don't). I haven't been able to access my data for over three days now because their barely-existent support is dragging their feet with helping me. For a paid app, the poor support from Monarch is completely unacceptable.",2024-12-12,1
Forced to start a free trial and sign up before getting to view the app. I absolutely will not sign up without getting a visual of the interface and features first. To see that immediately after opening the app for the first time was crazy. Why would I give you all my information for a trial when the trial advertisement is the only glimpse I've gotten of the entire app so far? Weird stuff.,2024-12-10,1
I never got to use it. It wouldn't let me in the app it would only show the free trial thing and wouldn't let me exit! Terrible!,2024-12-07,1

"This product claims to help you manage your finances, but it falls short of its promises. The syncing feature is unreliable, leaving your accounts out of date and inaccurate. Plus, the expense tagging system is hit or miss – often missing the mark entirely. If you are looking for a consistent and dependable budgeting app, steer clear of Monarch. Trust me, your time and money is better spent elsewhere.",2024-11-16,1

Not free required payment,2024-10-26,1
Awful. Connections kept resetting. I couldn't reclassify a mortgage account so the entire net worth/balance was off. The screen would freeze when trying to add connections and I'd have to close the app to get back to the home screen. All these 5 star reviews must be from the web version. Glad I canceled before the subscription started.,2024-10-26,1

Now paying (100/yr) for a service that's half as good as the (free) mint service was. No. Widgets or a lot of what made meant so good.

I'm trying to get a budgeting app. Because I'm not working right now and money is really tight. That's usually the point of a budgeting app is because money is tight. II downloaded the app and as soon as I answered a couple questions. They wanted me to pay a $100 a year when I have literally no money which is why I need a budgeting app. It's absolutely ridiculous to charge that much for it. So don't download it if you're expecting a free app or a cheap app.,2024-09-09,1

"Worthless. Accounts disconnect constantly. In my case, one of my linked accounts doesn't show the information in Monarch.

No big deal to them because you are expected to manually create rules. Support is terribly slow and useless.

After some changes recently connections with major banks require reauthorization every day. The support team refuses to admit that something changed and gives generic canned responses.

I really like this app for managing money but a glaring issue is it is hardly up to date with syncing multiple accounts. It would be one thing if I was using abnormal accounts but it takes days for it to accurately reflect transactions and accounts are almost never up to date even when manually forcing them to sync. This makes it to where I hardly use this even paying for the yearly subscription changes nothing.,2025-05-28,2

I ended up cancelling the sub. the budget tool works well for the most part but I haven't been able to sync my credit cards at all and I have tried it both with desk top site and the app. I don't know if it is just a Canada problem but it is why this app only gets 3 stars.,2025-05-27,2

You can still manually track and update accounts, but that destroys the purpose of the app, which is automatically getting balance and transactions from all your accounts.",2024-11-14,2

Unable to get a clear picture of spending pattern overall due to the app frequently categorising income as expenses and expenses as transfers. Not worth the paid subscription.,2024-04-05,2
"Similar functionality and design to Mint but more connection issues and data problems. I discovered monarch when I was looking for a replacement for Mint. Mint certainly wasn't perfect, but it was free and performed well. Monarch has much of the same functionality and similar design but I have more issues with Monach connecting to accounts. This is disappointing considering there is a cost to monarch and Mint was free.",2024-03-31,2

"Migrating from Mint. Web version works fine, but I've been unable to log in even once on the app. The login UX is not workable for my Pixel 3. The password field is hidden by the virtual keyboard, so you can't really see the characters as you are typing, and it invariably throws an error with login. Very poor experience as the app is unusable for me right now. For a paid product, if the app is downloadable on my device and has been updated to the latest version, I would expect it to work.",2024-03-27,2
"As many other I was forced off Mint. While functionality-wise Monarch beats Mint, these guys aren't even close in terms of stability and trust, which is important when you work with one's money. The website is buggy when you scroll your transactions down. I need to apply filters so it loads further transactions. It misses ""resolve (or at least detect) duplicates"" feature. The app is too raw as well. The trend graph doesn't change whether you choose to show 1 mo or 1 yr. Missing biometric login,",2024-03-25,2

Hate to say it but I'll be uninstalling this after my free trial",2024-03-12,2
"I love the interface and design of this app but there are tons of random bugs and issues that make it not worth the price. It uses Plaid and several similar platforms. My primary bank connects fine but fails to show any transactions. Transactions at my other banks take a long time to update even if I force refresh. It sends erroneous spending alerts, predicted recurring payments are never accurate and you can't load old transactions. Once you get past the AI customer service is ok but not great.",2024-03-11,2

"Have tried this for about 30 days. Many transactions have two zeros added when pending. The extra zeros will remain for a day or two and then correct when pending is removed. Also several deposits have shown as expenses when pending. This makes all reports worthless when items are pending. Monarch does not automatically add accounts to an existing bank. I needed to experiment and add the bank again, then the existing account was added twice, so I needed to delete the duplicate. Mint was better",2024-02-28,2
"A paid service that only works when it wants to. This application only works about 60% of the times. When it works it does things well but as soon as it doesn't work it can be frustrating. Connections don't work about 80% of the time. So you are spending most of your time doing things manually. Another issue is support, it is not responsive. I have filed about 5 support tickets since November and no one has gotten back to me. Again, this is a paid service and there is no support.",2024-02-21,2
Used to work flawlessly but now my transactions don't show up unless I remove my bank and then add it back. Every time I do that I lose all my data for the previous months.

Unfortunately, the phone optimized and desktop site access on my phone to monarch site also isn't fully functional (i.e. cant recategorize a transaction due to a bug in bringing up the keyboard closing the menu. The website with a laptop works just fine. Pretty annoyed.",2024-02-09,2
"Seems like a cool app but it's missing key functionality. In my case, I needed to be able to view transactions from my investment accounts in Fidelity. I use one of my investment accounts to pay my mortgage and credit card payments, so I want able to pull in my mortgage or credit card payments at all. That was throwing my numbers off and made the app unusable. I also sent a message to support and never heard back.",2024-02-07,2
Worse than Mint. I never had problems with bank feed connections on Mint but on Monarch they disconnect constantly. It makes the app basically unusable.,2024-02-03,2
Great app but horrible customer service. No one responds. Tried contacting wife's account and got billed twice,2024-01-25,2

Awful. Connections kept resetting. I couldn't reclassify a mortgage account so the entire net worth/balance was off.

II downloaded the app and as soon as I answered a couple questions.

"At first, I loved it. But then I started adding my investment accounts. The app has all kinds of problems. Biggest is all the sync issues and inability to specify past period to sync. So, my accounts keep desyncing and investment progress data is lost. I paid for two years of service, but had to wait a whole year to see past year trends just to face desyncs and having to restart the wait. Support staff are useless and refuse to help unless you send them screenshots, despite having access.",2025-05-06,3
"I was a Mint user for years and thought I would give this app 1 year to try. Monarch is buggy and inaccurate and cumbersome with some good features but canceled the subscription for all these reasons and more. Expensive app for not nearly as good a platform as Mint was. Don't waste your money, look elsewhere and I caution what the articles say about these types of apps because reading lead me to believe I was getting a much better platform than what Monarch really offers. Good luck.",2025-05-03,3

I'm a software dev. it doesn't matter how baller the concept is if I can't use the app. it do be looking look like a high school react project. it sucks because I can tell it's a good product that I would pay for if only anything made sense about the UX.,2025-04-29,3

"Not happy about the syncing feature, your accounts will randomly unsync and when they re sync they duplicate all of your transactions. I also got double charged from monarch and Google play store once, even though I quickly rectified the double charge it's annoying that it happened in the first place.",2025-04-09,3
"Good app to see all your finances in one place. however, there is zero customer service. Live chat is AI and not a person. No agent. The email option does not provide a text field where you can describe your issue. The Acorns Earn (shop) feature has exclusions, but Acorns does not spell out all the exclusions. I made multiple purchases from Acorns to Chewy and received no investment to my acct. Also, Walmart. Acorns used to be better... Customer service needs to improve a lot.",2025-04-03,3
After loading for 5 minutes it pulled my Questrade RRSP 4x instead of the separate accounts. Tried deleting and re-syncing and got the same issue.,2025-03-12,3
I'm in my trial period with Monarch and I've just noticed that Monarch does NOT automatically reconcile synced transactions with manual entries to prevent duplicates! Not good at all!! Plus there is no manual reconcile function that can be activated to catch these duplicates. I like to enter manual transactions then allow my financial software to match with them and merge to form one posted transaction. Also why isn't there a running balance in the transactions box?,2025-03-10,3
"I've paid for this product for around 3 years but I'm ready to try something else. Customer support is super attentive but to be honest I don't think they ever truly fixed my issues. The account disconnections are daily, I'm so over it. Plus it simply doesn't play well with Acorns investing despite months and months of working with support and waiting on a resolution. I can't say I recommend it at this point for those reasons. There's a lot of good here but not for the headache and the price",2025-02-28,3
"I have multiple linked accounts and it takes up to 5 days to bring in new transactions. This makes it very difficult to review them when all of a sudden there's 15 transactions to review and insure they get credited to the right categories when they're from 5 days ago or longer. Monarch, you have to do better. I need real time updates.",2025-02-25,3

"The app seems awesome and I would recommend if you can afford! What I didn't like was the FAKE discount code. Now maybe it works but the webside I clicked to use it there was NO WHERE to apply the discount code. I got this code because I canceled and they said I could extend my free trial and get half a year off for doing that. I tried for 3 days straight to try and apply this code. Either I signed back up so I couldn't use the code or they legit are hiding it. Either way, that is some BS.",2025-02-07,3
"No free version for people to utilize. At least Every Dollar has a free option for people who don't want to pay for a subscription. It's great you have no ads, but for people who are trying to save money, adding another subscription to their budget may not be an option. Also, no subscription fee was detailed in the description before downloading and then having to uninstall 2 minutes later. Would be nice to know there is a subscription beforehand. I increased the rating to a 2 for no ads.",2025-02-06,3
"Best alternative to Mint, and I've tried all the most prominent ones. Easily connects to ALL of my accounts and I have a lot. I'm very happy to have found Monarch and I recommend that you try them as well, especially if you got booted from Mint. Update 1/7/25 Had to change my five star review to a two star. Over the last few months this app has multiple issues connecting to my various accounts making it totally unusable. I no longer recommend. There's probably a better one out there.",2025-01-07,3
I'm a first-time user of this app I purchased the annual subscription. The app is not counting the cash starting balance for categories in the budget. This is in turn is causing a negative balance to show in the remaining column. I have reached out to support on several occasions the response received was log out log back in. Days have gone by with no further assistance. Looking into other options with better support and functionality. Increasingly frustrated.,2024-12-20,3

"This is not worth $100 a year by any stretch of the imagination. The only part that was really helpful was the real-time syncing across accounts. The budgeting tool is trash. It's not based on what's actually in your account, as Simple and its recent imitators have taught us to do. It assumes you're not living paychek-to-paycheck. I MIGHT keep it for its real-time account tracking, but after all these years, if you're still looking for a replacement for Simple, this isn't it.",2024-12-18,3

How does this not have widgets for $15/month. I'm baffled,2024-11-21,3
The app would be great for tracking finances but keeping all accounts syncing properly with the app is a full-time job and often does not work. My mortgage was transferred to a new provider and it still will not sync with the app despite many contacts with support. That's not the only problem my tiaa retirement accts periodically stop syncing and I have to delete them and reconnect losing all the stored info. Sadly I paid for a year - huge mistake. I was doing FAR better w/free app from Mint,2024-11-21,3
"No free option, and for what you are getting, there are better options, which are cheaper.",2024-11-21,3
"The app has a great potential, but has several issues that were mentioned by others. Constant account disconnects, requiring users to reconnect manually, which takes a lot of time. Support team is great, but engineering doesn't fix defects. There's an issue getting the correct amounts for various sites, including binance. You can still manually track and update accounts, but that destroys the purpose of the app, which is automatically getting balance and transactions from all your accounts.",2024-11-14,3
"If this app functioned as promised it would be great. Problem is there are so many connection issues when connecting to the bank that it takes more time than it's worth to login all the time. Even when it is supposedly connected, there are transactions missing. Considering I'm paying 19 bucks a month I expect better.",2024-11-13,3
"2 stars might be a little unfair because 1. This is better than any other app/service for personal finance and 2. No others have a widget, but I really don't get any use out of the app without a widget that shows all of my bank accounts and net worth",2024-11-04,3
It may be a great app but I need something free,2024-11-01,3
"Stopped processing EVERYTHING months ago from the bank I use for debit and bill pay transactions, so now I have to manually categorize and adjust. I came over from Mint. This lack of processing would be annoying but grudgingly acceptable if free, but since it's not a free service, I won't bother renewing. Overall features are ok but not processing my primary bank (which used to work) is a deal-breaker.",2024-10-25,3
"Not with paying for in my opinion. Constant issues with connectivity to other services. And at times the app shows ridiculously incorrect amounts in your accounts. It's a cool product and has many nice features, but it's not worth the money due to the repetitive issues. If it was free, sure, you get what you pay for. But I'm not paying to troubleshoot connectivity issues and wonder why I'm being shown incorrect information.",2024-10-24,3
"It was working great for me until I added my auto loan account. Then, suddenly, I couldn't see anything. No transactions, no budget, it was extremely glitchy. Very sad this happened.",2024-10-21,3
"Another very broken, feature-light, all-in-one personal finance app that doesn't do anything particularly well. I switched to this after Intuit shut down Mint, and I spend at least 30 minutes a week trying to fix broken account connections. It's a losing battle. Anyway, don't download this. Use a spreadsheet. You will spend the same amount of time.",2024-10-19,3
"Monarch constantly disconnects from my accounts, so the information is not up to date. I have to sync it almost weekly, which is so frustrating. The in-app functionality is fine, but it's pointless if I can't access my data all in one place.",2024-10-08,3
Monarch is too expensive!! I cannot justify paying $100 per year when I can pay use other budgeting apps that are half the cost.,2024-10-07,3
"I love the app feature set and functionality, however the data brokers are so janky that whenever I log a ticket the support team just says ""import transactions manually"". At the beginning of the year they would at least troubleshoot it, but now they don't even bother. Due to this I would only recommend it for someone that like nice UI but doesn't mind doing 80% of the work manually.",2024-09-25,3
"It all looks good and at first I was super happy with the idea of saving time. I double checked the numbers the first full month after I bought the description and noticed that not all of the dates of transactions registered, even after it synced multiple times. For example, only after going through the numbers did I realize major purchases were just missing for up to gaps of 10 day periods. Without this fixed and me not knowing the accuracy of numbers, I wish I hadn't bought the subscription.",2024-08-28,3

"Customer service is awful and the bug that duplicates my transaction over and over makes it unusable. If you have any issue, their first step is to have you delete and reconnect the account. This may or may not fix the problem, but it does delete any manual edits you made to transactions so you have to go back and re-do all of them. I had to argue with the rep to get them to look at my CRITICAL issue. Only to finally find out that it's a known problem they just haven't fixed yet!",2024-08-21,3
The app is very unfriendly and inflexible. It was very difficult to use. Not for me!,2024-08-19,3
Mediocre at best. More effort put into colors and emojis than function and layout. Budget page is a lot of itemized information and little to no summary of the month as a whole. No specific tablet app. Just large format mobile version with lots of dead space. Browser version (chrome) on tablet glitches continuously. Not even worth the 50% rate I paid.,2024-08-16,3
"I mean, it seems like a good app with good features, but I couldn't even try it because there's no button to skip the free trial of the membership. I'm not paying for a budgeting app since I can do the same thing in an Excel sheet, admittedly with a few extra steps.

I don't have these problems with other services I'm trying as a Mint replacement. I doubt I will renew my subscription when it expires.",2024-07-12,3

"After using Mint for over a decade, this app has been very frustrating. Accounts frequently fail to update and the app crashes randomly. Considering the cost associated with the Monarch, you would expect this app to be better than Mint, but, sadly, it's not.

"The app is actually decent, but their support is a joke. Opened a ticket to get a simple account authorization, which they could've changed in the db easily (5 minutes of work).

I'll take my business elsewhere.",2024-05-03,3
"No Android widgets is the biggest downside. It also logged me out after spending a significant amount of time organizing mint transaction categories, which I then had to redo from scratch. Not to mention it was bugged and wouldn't allow me to create new categories during import process. I'll update my review when I see Android widgets.",2024-05-02,3

"Switched from Mint. Was excited to use this app since it seemed to have better functionalities, however Wealthsimple Canada cannot be synced which is a big let down since its one of the main institutions in Canada for investments. Monarch needs to figure it out if they want Canadian user to keep using the app. I'm unfortunately not gonna renew after my free trial and will try to find an app that works with Wealthsimple",2024-04-11,3
Buggy external connections. Many institutions are not supported e.g. WeBull. Some connected institutions frequently lose connection and the app just spins trying to reconnect. Unable to get a clear picture of spending pattern overall due to the app frequently categorising income as expenses and expenses as transfers. Not worth the paid subscription.,2024-04-05,3
"Similar functionality and design to Mint but more connection issues and data problems. I discovered monarch when I was looking for a replacement for Mint. Mint certainly wasn't perfect, but it was free and performed well. Monarch has much of the same functionality and similar design but I have more issues with Monach connecting to accounts. This is disappointing considering there is a cost to monarch and Mint was free.",2024-03-31,3

"Migrating from Mint. Web version works fine, but I've been unable to log in even once on the app. The login UX is not workable for my Pixel 3. The password field is hidden by the virtual keyboard, so you can't really see the characters as you are typing, and it invariably throws an error with login. Very poor experience as the app is unusable for me right now. For a paid product, if the app is downloadable on my device and has been updated to the latest version, I would expect it to work.",2024-03-27,3
"As many other I was forced off Mint. While functionality-wise Monarch beats Mint, these guys aren't even close in terms of stability and trust, which is important when you work with one's money. The website is buggy when you scroll your transactions down. I need to apply filters so it loads further transactions. It misses ""resolve (or at least detect) duplicates"" feature. The app is too raw as well. The trend graph doesn't change whether you choose to show 1 mo or 1 yr. Missing biometric login,",2024-03-25,3

"I love the interface and design of this app but there are tons of random bugs and issues that make it not worth the price. It uses Plaid and several similar platforms. My primary bank connects fine but fails to show any transactions. Transactions at my other banks take a long time to update even if I force refresh. It sends erroneous spending alerts, predicted recurring payments are never accurate and you can't load old transactions. Once you get past the AI customer service is ok but not great.",2024-03-11,3

That was throwing my numbers off and made the app unusable. I also sent a message to support and never heard back.",2024-02-07,3

"Decent for tracking spending patterns but every couple of weeks we get a notification from Monarch hat one of our bank accounts has been disconnected. When accounts are disconnected we can't see our total financial picture and transactions don't upload. It seems like we're always going through the steps of reconnecting different accounts. Also, but this is less important, it doesn't support one of our banks or have any options for CDN funds so it's hard to see our total picture.",2025-06-03,3

Not the best. You need to continuously reconnect accounts and cannot run simple reports such as year end account summaries.

App seems good sofar.,2025-02-01,3
Hate the new format to change dates - instead of opening a calendar now you have to scroll through dates to change the transaction date.

Otherwise a great app but don't change what's working well!,2025-01-21,3

"I experienced more bugs in just 1 day of using this app than I did in 3 years of using YNAB. So much functionality is broken or poorly thought out. The biggest flaw to me is that, compared to YNAB, this app feels totally disconnected from my actual money. I could budget $1 billion a month and Monarch would happily oblige. Even at 50% off, it's not worth it compared to YNAB, which is rock solid reliable.",2025-01-11,3
"I like the idea of the app but not quite what I'm needing. I have been looking for a Prism replacement for over a year. Prism had bill pay and very good bill tracking. If Monarch could implement this, it would be beautiful.",2025-01-10,3

"App quality dropping with recent updates. For example, tapping to try and create a rule does nothing, the tap registers in the UI below. So either use the web app or deal with time-wasting toil. Also the app isn't any smarter since I started using 1 year ago -- still counts money transferred to checking as paycheck and money transferred from checking to another account as ATM. 🙃 As a UX designer, I wish they'd focus more on improving the core experience than changing to a frufru logo.",2024-12-31,3

"Lots of useful features, and definitely worth paying for. Where it fell down for me was on the connectivity to my financial institutions.

"The base idea is good, but the app needs some work. Goals are not intuitive right now and linking broken accounts takes forever, especially less name brand accounts.

There really should be an option where you can put in the info and leave the page.",2024-11-22,3
"this app is still far away from Empower for investments management. as a Empower user, since some of my accounts have connection issues, I am considering switching away. tried monarch, but it didn't meet my expectations. the investment allocation is too basic.

In less than a year of using it, I've already submitted 5 support tickets due to issues on their side. Resolution time on these can be fairly long.

"I love this app. It's the best budgeting app I've come across. Relatively easy to use, aesthetically pleasing, lots of things to track. This is a 5 star app except for ONE thing. Monarch has a huge problem with randomly disconnecting from your accounts. It seems like every week, a different one of my accounts is disconnected and I have to go in and try to reconnect it. This happens very often, and it's super annoying. Other than this issue, I'd give the app 5 stars.",2024-08-16,3
A decent replacement for mint. Needs work on its refresh intervals though. You get reports that are a day or two late because it only syncs every 12-24 hours,2024-08-07,3

"Some bugs with net worth calculat.I spend too much time removing and re-adding manual accounts just because the networth looked off. Then doing so, I see the networth randomly go worse and there's no way to fix it. The account balance looks right on the accts but the numbers look wrong in the account details. Editing the account doesn't fix anything. Doing so also makes the investments charts go bad as well even tho the accounts I removed and readded had no investments.

"My accounts were disconnected due to inactivity. Now I have to add in all of my accounts again. I miss the feature Mint were is the account was disconnected for any reason I could log back in and reset that way. I was a big fan of how the system for Mint work.

"App overall works well but needs to be brought up to parity with iOS version (widgets, etc)",2024-06-08,3
Monarch is pretty good for helping me with keeping track of all of my transactions and helping to show my financial information in a simple way. What I don't like is that I am paying for something that has problems connecting to all of my accounts. It bothers me when you setup a credit card account and then you get an error that Monarch can't connect. I have a couple cards that haven't connected in months. This doesn't help me see my whole financial picture.,2024-06-03,3
"It's a nice app, but buggy. My investments total shows that I have 18 million dollars (I wish.) Support has been totally MIA.

Not worth the cost.,2024-04-07,3
"It's okay. I had to find a new app after mint closed, and I was stuck between this one and YNAB. While I do prefer this interface, YNAB allows me to have multiple budgets and invite people to only view the budget they were invited to. Without the ability to have multiple budgets I don't know if this app is worth $100 a year.",2024-04-06,3
I would sign up if we didn't have to put our payment info in. They say they will email a reminder to let us know that the free trial will be over. But why couldn't they email us at that time that if we want to continue that we will need to put in the payment option if we want to.,2024-04-03,3

"Functional, but still very buggy. This app functions properly about 80% of the time. The remaining 20% features random, weird bugs that are not repeatable and come and go randomly. Accounts not updating for months, but Monarch says they are still connected. I had to delete, reconnect to fix that issue. Now, my 401K balance will magically change to exactly $50,000 randomly (it has happened twice). Not sure why it randomly goes to exactly $50,000.",2024-03-27,3

Didn't even finish setting up the account. Once I saw the monthly and year cost. I decided this app was not for me.,2024-01-28,3
Not as good as Rocket Money in terms of managing investments and not as good as Mint or Rocket Money in terms of providing transaction details. You only get snippets and not the whole thing. It is also not yet good at automatically determining which transaction belong to what category. You will for the most part have do that yourself. But in the most important parts it excels or improves on. All of my banks can be linked here. I imagine this app being better than those other two in 2-3 years.,2024-01-26,3
"Overall l, I like it. But the app has serious problems. Crashes within minutes every time. Monarch is great in the web app.",2024-01-24,3
"Monarch is solid with a few rough edges. Its worst feature is that it uses ""dark patterns"" to artificially boost its review scores here on the Play store. It asks users if they like the app, then asks them to rate the app on the Play store only if they say yes. Therefore, you can't trust the rating to be accurate. Monarch is shaping up to be a decent replacement for Mint, and I'm rooting for the Monarch team to succeed in delivering a quality product without anti-user policies.",2024-01-19,3
It's fine. The delay in syncing accounts is absolutely ridiculous though. Two of my accounts are reporting amounts that are two days old yet the connection status says that it is healthy and has been updated in the last hour. The YNAB type budgeting feels half baked.,2024-01-19,3

Constantly dropping connections with my banks. Problems that I didn't ever have with Mint. I really like this app but these problems make using this app pointless. My net worth and spending are thousands of dollars off of reality because it won't sync my transactions correctly. And with the newest update transactions are constantly being recategorized making it extremely difficult to keep track of my budget.,2025-01-22,4
PWA (desktop app) constantly tries to access my microphone!?! Even though that permission isn't enąbled nor found on the Google store apk. Not sure what that's about but something is fishy. Oh yeah plus spending $100 on a buggy bad at math budgeting app is asanine.,2025-01-19,4

Forced to start a free trial and sign up before getting to view the app. I absolutely will not sign up without getting a visual of the interface and features first.

We are nine days into the month of febuary and it says I already went over several of my budgets. When I change the budget amount for specific things it changes it back and then sends me another email saying that I went over. It's blowing up my phone with notifications.

I really like this app for managing money but a glaring issue is it is hardly up to date with syncing multiple accounts. It would be one thing if I was using abnormal accounts but it takes days for it to accurately reflect transactions and accounts are almost never up to date even when manually forcing them to sync. This makes it to where I hardly use this even paying for the yearly subscription changes nothing.,2025-05-28,4

I ended up cancelling the sub. the budget tool works well for the most part but I haven't been able to sync my credit cards at all and I have tried it both with desk top site and the app. I don't know if it is just a Canada problem but it is why this app only gets 3 stars.,2025-05-27,4

The app would be great for tracking finances but keeping all accounts syncing properly with the app is a full-time job and often does not work. My mortgage was transferred to a new provider and it still will not sync with the app despite many contacts with support. That's not the only problem my tiaa retirement accts periodically stop syncing and I have to delete them and reconnect losing all the stored info. Sadly I paid for a year - huge mistake.

You can still manually track and update accounts, but that destroys the purpose of the app, which is automatically getting balance and transactions from all your accounts.",2024-11-14,4
"If this app functioned as promised it would be great. Problem is there are so many connection issues when connecting to the bank that it takes more time than it's worth to login all the time.

That was throwing my numbers off and made the app unusable. I also sent a message to support and never heard back.",2024-02-07,4

UI is very nice but account reliability needs to come first. Likely will switch to YNAB since I still have a trial.,2024-01-08,4
"I have about almost 10,000 transactions that to import into Monarch from Mint. But the it only import 1 years worth of data. For the price of the app, i should be able to import all my history. Can someone from Monarch help me to import the rest? Otherwise I will need to look for another program to try.",2024-01-02,4
pricey but good!,2025-06-12,4
"I used Intuit and moved to Monarch mainly because I like the sankey charts. Their ability to tag transactions as recurring is really bad, I would have expected so much more from a paid app. The reporting is really good and the visuals is what is keeping me a customer.",2025-06-08,4
"Decent for tracking spending patterns but every couple of weeks we get a notification from Monarch hat one of our bank accounts has been disconnected. When accounts are disconnected we can't see our total financial picture and transactions don't upload. It seems like we're always going through the steps of reconnecting different accounts. Also, but this is less important, it doesn't support one of our banks or have any options for CDN funds so it's hard to see our total picture.",2025-06-03,4
I would have given it a better rating if it had an easier way to do things. it seemed like you had to take the long way around to get something done. many times with unwanted results.,2025-05-31,4
"Much too expensive for normal use. I used Mint for years free and while I'm willing to pay, Monarch is asking more than any app should. I highly doubt they can justify the cost without resorting to delusion.",2025-05-10,4
"I think it's ok. I loved it when I did the shorter 7 day trial but now that I have used other paid budget apps, this one is not my favorite.",2025-04-22,4
"Having issues with keeping a good connection with the bank, also have noticed a few transactions never came to Monarch. At this point I wish monarch would have a basic premium that I would have to manually enter everything myself. Don't feel like paying premium price and then have to enter everything myself.",2025-04-16,4
The app is good but transactions take forever to appear. Really need to improve the speed,2025-03-20,4
Great app so far after replacing mint. But no widgets on android is criminal.,2025-03-17,4
Not the best. You need to continuously reconnect accounts and cannot run simple reports such as year end account summaries. Reports have very limited configuration options and they dump out every transaction. I don't need a QuickBooks replacement just a functional app with decent reports.,2025-03-04,4
"(paid service) generally great, but Fidelity account sync shows wrong amount, significantly wrong",2025-02-23,4
"$99 for a year or $49 with a discount current as of when I am writing this, but no android widget. I'll stick with the free competitor I use, that has a widget. I don't love the way the app looks, it seems cluttered with little visual distinctions between things. I could use 100% fewer emojis, but I think I could have deleted those. 7 day free trial is not enough to determine if I was really going to like the system. Tried it out for 1 day but cancelled immediately when I saw there's no widget",2025-02-21,4
"Been using the app for 4 months, tracking all expenses and constantly fine-tuning my budget. One morning it all went wrong. CC transactions showed up in my car loan, net worth calculations were impacted. Reached out to support and they've responded but it's only been with more questions. I've had to figure out on my own that I could move transactions between accounts on a computer and that I can manually update the balance history to hopefully get the net worth calculation. Not impressed!",2025-02-13,4
No widgets available for android home screen. Should be an obvious feature.,2025-02-11,4
"The parts that work, work very well, but there are some serious issues. I can't connect to two of my banks, so I can't update loan information, and manual transaction entries don't update balances. In order to update the balances I have to upload a csv file and if it doesn't work I would have to delete the entire account to fix it.",2025-02-06,4
"Switched from Mint after nearly a decade. There's lots of room for improvement. In order of issues for me: 1. Doesn't connect to Treasury. 2. income doesn't roll over 3. notes taken on pending transactions don't stay once approved 4. when moving leftover money from one budget to another, it doesn't actually move the leftover as a transfer, it just changes the budgets themselves. That's not what I want because then it stays the same the next month.",2025-02-05,4
App seems good sofar.,2025-02-01,4
Hate the new format to change dates - instead of opening a calendar now you have to scroll through dates to change the transaction date. If you can't remember what day of the week it was you have to open up your own calendar and switch between the two apps. Please put the old date / calendar back!!! Why change what was working well?? Otherwise a great app but don't change what's working well!,2025-01-21,4
I'm sure your app is great just not very budget-friendly. $15 a month is quite steep for a app especially if you're trying to watch your money,2025-01-21,4
"I'm currently on my free trial and I'm loving it, but I really want to use the monthly subscription option for a bit before committing to the yearly, but I can't get the monthly through the app store. When I try to get it on my computer, it wants me to make a new account to get the monthly.",2025-01-15,4
Definitely could be useful to some but adding in another subscription service kinda defeats the point especially one that cost $15 monthly at minimum,2025-01-14,4
"It's an amazing app, but every day it disconnects my main bank and credit card and won't just reconnect without me completely removing and adding them back in. Which of course means I have to redo all transactions again... Please make the reconnect button work, then it would be perfect!",2025-01-14,4
"I experienced more bugs in just 1 day of using this app than I did in 3 years of using YNAB. So much functionality is broken or poorly thought out. The biggest flaw to me is that, compared to YNAB, this app feels totally disconnected from my actual money. I could budget $1 billion a month and Monarch would happily oblige. Even at 50% off, it's not worth it compared to YNAB, which is rock solid reliable.",2025-01-11,4
"I like the idea of the app but not quite what I'm needing. I have been looking for a Prism replacement for over a year. Prism had bill pay and very good bill tracking. If Monarch could implement this, it would be beautiful.",2025-01-10,4
Great features but was constantly disconnecting from my financial accounts so I never had up to date numbers. If you use PNC you'll likely have the same issue.,2025-01-04,4
"App quality dropping with recent updates. For example, tapping to try and create a rule does nothing, the tap registers in the UI below. So either use the web app or deal with time-wasting toil. Also the app isn't any smarter since I started using 1 year ago -- still counts money transferred to checking as paycheck and money transferred from checking to another account as ATM. 🙃 As a UX designer, I wish they'd focus more on improving the core experience than changing to a frufru logo.",2024-12-31,4
Fix the UI so that I can't click something until the page is completely loaded. It's annoying clicking a category for an expense and having it change a few milliseconds before the click.,2024-12-28,4
"Lots of useful features, and definitely worth paying for. Where it fell down for me was on the connectivity to my financial institutions. It missed transactions in one account at one f.i. and was wholly unable to connect to another. If not for these issues, I would gladly still be using the service today.",2024-12-19,4
"App is free, but without subscription I can't use. Yes, I can choose trial, but I'll miss it...",2024-12-06,4
"the monarch app is great; however, it still does not have an android widget, which is really disappointing.",2024-12-05,4
Doesn't play nice with betterment at all. It constantly misses transactions,2024-11-30,4
So far I have barely used it but like what I see,2024-11-28,4
"This is free app? If you say yes, tell me please, why l can't skip offer to subscribe, and start using app?",2024-11-26,4
"The base idea is good, but the app needs some work. Goals are not intuitive right now and linking broken accounts takes forever, especially less name brand accounts. I understand these accounts are trickier, but everyone is going to have some of these random accounts they want to link (HSAs, Student Loans, etc.). There really should be an option where you can put in the info and leave the page.",2024-11-22,4
"this app is still far away from Empower for investments management. as a Empower user, since some of my accounts have connection issues, I am considering switching away. tried monarch, but it didn't meet my expectations. the investment allocation is too basic. I expect to see more details about where my money is invested, e.g. core vs growth, large vs small cap. these are all missing. sorry I am not ready to pay $100 for the current shape.",2024-11-14,4
"overall great experience, but short on including all accounts from certain institutions",2024-10-31,4
"You have to pay for the service after 7 days. In my opinion, it's implied that this is a free app.",2024-10-12,4
"Initially, I was pretty happy with Monarch. However, I have found that the service is pretty buggy. In less than a year of using it, I've already submitted 5 support tickets due to issues on their side. Resolution time on these can be fairly long. They have been issues ranging from accounts that stop syncing up to the product becoming completely unusable due to transactions tied to deleted accounts. I haven't decided yet if I will renew my subscription when the time comes in a couple months.",2024-10-03,4
"The app and features look great on paper but there are so many things wrong with this app. The numbers sometimes doesn't make any sense. I don't understand who design the UI but it is so hard to understand which one is negative and positive. Also, data connection is spotty and can't be trust. They blame it on 3rd party but I never have problem with Mint, or YNAB. Customer service is not very helpful when i tried to report all the issues. I gave up. Once my year is over, im switching.",2024-09-16,4
No widgets for Android,2024-09-13,4
Still no widget :*( One of my favorite things about Mint was the variety of widgets available for Android. I could check in on transactions very easily. This app *still* hasn't implemented anything of the sort despite being a paid platform. It's a bit disappointing for Mint crossovers.,2024-09-04,4
"I love this app. It's the best budgeting app I've come across. Relatively easy to use, aesthetically pleasing, lots of things to track. This is a 5 star app except for ONE thing. Monarch has a huge problem with randomly disconnecting from your accounts. It seems like every week, a different one of my accounts is disconnected and I have to go in and try to reconnect it. This happens very often, and it's super annoying. Other than this issue, I'd give the app 5 stars.",2024-08-16,4
A decent replacement for mint. Needs work on its refresh intervals though. You get reports that are a day or two late because it only syncs every 12-24 hours,2024-08-07,4
cost outweighs the features and utilities.,2024-08-05,4
hoping to eventually connect to my mortgage company,2024-07-26,4
This will truly be the killer app once they iron out goals and budgeting.,2024-07-20,4
"The app is great when everything is updated and working properly. The problem is that they struggle with all the banks getting updated information. You have to keep logging in over and over again. Lots of time it won't work and it ends up being a huge waste of time. When everything is working properly though, the app is great!",2024-07-20,4
"Some bugs with net worth calculat.I spend too much time removing and re-adding manual accounts just because the networth looked off. Then doing so, I see the networth randomly go worse and there's no way to fix it. The account balance looks right on the accts but the numbers look wrong in the account details. Editing the account doesn't fix anything. Doing so also makes the investments charts go bad as well even tho the accounts I removed and readded had no investments. I regret paying for this.",2024-07-14,4
This app will not show forecast balance even though it has all the data required. Not even for $90 a year. Uninstalled after 5 days.,2024-07-06,4
"Apps not bad, actually like it a lot, but had to drop a few stars because I hate when apps pop up asking for a review when I'm busy trying to get something done.",2024-07-05,4
Monarch has issues linking with various prominent financial institutions like Fidelity and Discover; I don't understand how this app can justify their price with these issues.,2024-06-28,4
Its great when it works. But it regulalry has issues with account connections tht break and cant be reconnected. Very frustrating for a paid service.,2024-06-27,4
"My accounts were disconnected due to inactivity. Now I have to add in all of my accounts again. I miss the feature Mint were is the account was disconnected for any reason I could log back in and reset that way. I was a big fan of how the system for Mint work. It is jarring to go from a free service to one that cost $50 for one year, then $100 each year after. I would hope the team managing this app are well paid.",2024-06-27,4
"App overall works well but needs to be brought up to parity with iOS version (widgets, etc)",2024-06-08,4
Monarch is pretty good for helping me with keeping track of all of my transactions and helping to show my financial information in a simple way. What I don't like is that I am paying for something that has problems connecting to all of my accounts. It bothers me when you setup a credit card account and then you get an error that Monarch can't connect. I have a couple cards that haven't connected in months. This doesn't help me see my whole financial picture.,2024-06-03,4
"It's a nice app, but buggy. My investments total shows that I have 18 million dollars (I wish.) Support has been totally MIA. When they finally responded months later, they said that's normal behavior for the app. Um, what? Update: Months later. Same issues persist. This app is as buggy as a beta.",2024-04-30,4
Not worth the cost.,2024-04-07,4
"It's okay. I had to find a new app after mint closed, and I was stuck between this one and YNAB. While I do prefer this interface, YNAB allows me to have multiple budgets and invite people to only view the budget they were invited to. Without the ability to have multiple budgets I don't know if this app is worth $100 a year.",2024-04-06,4
I would sign up if we didn't have to put our payment info in. They say they will email a reminder to let us know that the free trial will be over. But why couldn't they email us at that time that if we want to continue that we will need to put in the payment option if we want to.,2024-04-03,4
"It's a good app, but don't say I'm getting charged 100$ when I'm actually being charged 140$ CAD. It's confusing.",2024-03-29,4
"Functional, but still very buggy. This app functions properly about 80% of the time. The remaining 20% features random, weird bugs that are not repeatable and come and go randomly. Accounts not updating for months, but Monarch says they are still connected. I had to delete, reconnect to fix that issue. Now, my 401K balance will magically change to exactly $50,000 randomly (it has happened twice). Not sure why it randomly goes to exactly $50,000.",2024-03-27,4
Almost finished with our free trial. Trying to change transactions is very buggy after making one change. Have to refresh the page and would take forever to correct transactions past 30 days.,2024-03-24,4
"Too expensive and missing features for what I need. Looking for a single pane of glass for account balances and net worth, available via a widget. If they were to add that and offer just those features at a lower price point, I'd pay for that.",2024-03-22,4
Good basic money manager,2024-03-11,4
Mortgage integration no longer works. Overall nice user interface.,2024-03-09,4
Good tool but investment accounts are still not great and WS and Questrade keep disconnecting,2024-03-05,4
"No widgets for Android? Loved that feature on Mint, was always able to get a snapshot of my financial health without having to go into the app. Also, $100 subscription doesn't seem worth it based on the experiences of other reviewers.",2024-03-01,4
"Honestly, installed and immediately uninstalled. I think it would probably work for managing my budget, but $15/month or $150/year is NOT in my budget. There are other free apps that work great.",2024-03-01,4
"More ways to look at data than Mint, but also more work to configure. Does not reliably connect to some banks.",2024-02-29,4
User support is subpar.,2024-02-27,4
Very disappointed that I was forced to upgrade in order to use the app. I don't have playstore so updating is not an easy thing for me. Sucked to be locked out of the app until I was able to port the apk using another phone.,2024-02-17,4
"Nice UI, auto categorization sucks, subscription detection sucks , $100/year definitely not worth it. You should have tiers for people that don't need as many connections with lower prices. Simplifi is half the cost (not as many bank connections) Emma gives you 2 free bank connections Empower is free and connects to everything. I'm personally doing Emma since I have 2 main banks for spending and everything else (HSA, 401k, etc) can be tracked on empower",2024-02-07,4
Ok. Wish I could ACTUALLY see transactions and balances in real time. So far it's about 20h behind. Refreshing all accounts did nothing.,2024-02-04,4
Didn't even finish setting up the account. Once I saw the monthly and year cost. I decided this app was not for me.,2024-01-28,4
Not as good as Rocket Money in terms of managing investments and not as good as Mint or Rocket Money in terms of providing transaction details. You only get snippets and not the whole thing. It is also not yet good at automatically determining which transaction belong to what category. You will for the most part have do that yourself. But in the most important parts it excels or improves on. All of my banks can be linked here. I imagine this app being better than those other two in 2-3 years.,2024-01-26,4
"Overall l, I like it. But the app has serious problems. Crashes within minutes every time. Monarch is great in the web app.",2024-01-24,4
"Monarch is solid with a few rough edges. Its worst feature is that it uses ""dark patterns"" to artificially boost its review scores here on the Play store. It asks users if they like the app, then asks them to rate the app on the Play store only if they say yes. Therefore, you can't trust the rating to be accurate. Monarch is shaping up to be a decent replacement for Mint, and I'm rooting for the Monarch team to succeed in delivering a quality product without anti-user policies.",2024-01-19,4
It's fine. The delay in syncing accounts is absolutely ridiculous though. Two of my accounts are reporting amounts that are two days old yet the connection status says that it is healthy and has been updated in the last hour. The YNAB type budgeting feels half baked.,2024-01-19,4
customer support does not seem to exist.,2024-01-13,4
"The app alerted me to a recurring charge to my credit card that ended up being fraudulent. The charge was for a subscription on Amazon and was buried within my other Amazon purchases. I am having connectivity with my bank. The bank keeps requiring me to log in again. It's hard to get upset about too much security, though.",2025-06-10,4
Great program. Switched from Mint when it stopped being a financial tracking program. works very similarly.,2025-06-06,4
This is the best replacement for Mint I've been able to find. PayPal is dodgy but that's because PayPal is horrible.,2025-06-04,4
"Good basic platform for tracking finances. Wish they had annual budget categories or ""every 3 months"" etc (rollover is just useless).

"Great overall, but missing some features",2025-05-14,4
"Doesn't have complete parity with the web app but it's designed so well that I am more productive in most in the Android app than I an on the web app. This is key since I don't have a lot of time to sit down and open up my laptop to budget like I used to with Mint, which led me to fall behind on tracking finances.",2025-05-08,4
it's a good app and easy to use. The only issue I've experienced is the occasional transaction that disappears.,2025-04-22,4
"Mostly good. There's an annoying bug with the app (web and phone) where it will attempt to auto name some transactions, but the logic behind this is buggy, especially when using another service like Google Pay. The app will label it ""Google Pay"" automatically and obscure the actual merchant and often will misscategorize it as well. Frustrating to have to go line by line to fix these issues.",2025-04-18,4
Love it.. but make an android widget for a 5 star!,2025-04-17,4
"You think the app does a great job of consolidating all of my financial sources into one place. I do find the app a little bit outdated as it relates to pictures, icons etc. also downloading some of the financial accounts was not possible for whatever reason - not compatible with plaid etc. otherwise, a pretty good site.",2025-04-14,4
ok,2025-04-13,4
"Recently started using this again and added amounts that were previously not supported. It's nice to see the expansion of account support for a comprehensive view of finances. I exclusively used Mint (Android) in the past and the widget was invaluable and used all the time. The use of a widget for cash flow or transactions is paramount to allow for closely monitored finances. I think without the widget (something always in your face), the app disappears unless routine is established.",2025-04-06,4

cashflow analysis is complex,2025-03-18,4
"It's a great app that they keep updating. The items it's missing is a better AI to analyze your finances, more options for charts/timelines and updated reporting.

"Only used it for a bit, but so far so good. Only thing is I wish it had widgets for android homescreen",2025-03-10,4
"I've been using Monarch for a little over two weeks now, and I'm impressed with how easy it is to track and budget my finances across multiple bank accounts.

It sometimes mysteriously stops updating account info but doesn't always tell you that the data is outdated. I have to be very observant of transaction dates to check that the info is accurate.

If you were a fan of Mint and you can stomach the cost it's a fantastic app with responsive devs. This company handles your data (think selling it) better than most but some of their plugins still pull some and they are working on solutions....still the best out there.

"Easy to customize budget, track expenses and see trends over time. The more you customize rules the less time you spend on adjusting categories. I just wish the app included more reporting functions as offered on the web version.",2024-11-27,4
"I love this app, does everything I need it to do. I'd give 5 stars if it allowed me to connect investment accounts (e.g., National Bank Direct Brokerage) as right now it doesn't support that. Already submitted that as an idea so I'm hopeful it'll eventually happen!",2024-11-25,4
"great app, consistently improving with new features. it would save me a lot of time of there were marketplace integrations like Amazon.",2024-11-25,4
Why I can't skip first offer?,2024-11-21,4
"Hands down, my favorite budgeting app. The only reason I give it 4 stars out of 5 is because the group and category functionality is fairly restrictive, cumbersome, and honestly, annoying.",2024-11-10,4
the UI can be better,2024-11-06,4
"Solid way to get visibility on many accounts at once & review transactions. Could benefit from some protection or conceptual scenario or long term goal planning. Budgeting & automatic categorization could use a little more ""smarts"".",2024-11-05,4
"Beautiful App, But Needs Improvements",2024-11-05,4
"Generally a good app, helpful for expense and budgeting. $99/yr seems a little high given the opportunities for data selling on the back end, and some app functionality doesn't work on my Pixel tablet, like category updating.",2024-11-03,4
Great app for putting all your finances in one place.,2024-10-31,4
"program is easy to use and has good visuals. unlike mint, the rules appear to work consistently",2024-10-24,4
"I switched from Mint to this program and I liked it, but the program lacks a widget that can show the cache flow and data directly on the home screen without the need to enter the program. How can a free program like Mint have this feature while I do not see it here in a paid program?",2024-10-10,4
"I have only been using it a few weeks, but I like it. It's so easy to use and it shows me all my information in one place.",2024-10-10,4
could be slightly easier to make new budgets and quarterly budgets - but overall a great tool!,2024-10-09,4
"Good app, I have a few complaints here and there but nothing major. Unfortunately not for me as I can't go back to traditional budgeting after getting used to ZBB for so long.",2024-10-02,4
Great app but too expensive.,2024-09-29,4
its a good app..,2024-09-23,4
"Great app for managing finances and lots of work on new features. Needs some polishing, but overall would recommend.",2024-09-22,4
"App is nice but I didn't want both of my bank accounts on the app. One is an account I manage for a relative, and it is muddying up my spending and budgets.",2024-09-21,4
"once I figure out the credit card payment/transfer, it may bump up another star",2024-09-20,4
better than Mint; needs work on connections with government sites like 529 and Treasury direct and on being able to distinguish parts of payments as principle vs interest (transfers vs gains/losses) but otherwise great. invaluable tool for keeping track of accounts.,2024-09-17,4
"Came over as a Mint user when that service was end of lifed. Monarch has been great importing all our accounts, and makes it easy to review and categorize transactions between my wife and I. The only feature I feel that is missing in comparison is the ability to manage bills. Monarch will detect and allow you to manage recurring merchants and transactions, but it's not quite the same for recurring bills",2024-09-09,4
This app needs widgets for Android home screen.,2024-08-29,4
best alternative to mint,2024-08-29,4
"app works very well, I like the networth tracker. only down side is it doesn't currently work with webull. hopefully this gets added soon. otherwise I'm happy",2024-08-28,4
"Amazing app for managing your finances. Highlights: One account gives two people access, so you dont need to pay for 2 accounts if you are a couple. Lots of customization, you get to set up your finances the way you like. The transaction info coming in from the bank is always accurate; we've never had a problem with that. The only issues I've had with the app are A) the ""goals"" feature is a little confusing at first, and B) categories are basically impossible to fully retire.",2024-08-25,4
Been using since Mint was 'souled out'. Seems pretty good a couple months in. A widget on Android would be nice.,2024-08-23,4
"very good! My only complaint is that they didn't have a customer service line to call. It's very frustrating to me. Other than that, it's super helpful",2024-08-17,4
Love monarch. Just wish that my pending transaction categorizations would stick once they've posted.,2024-08-16,4
a great financial aggregator for accounts. could improve their investments comparison and visualizations.,2024-08-10,4
"Easy to setup and use, connections mostly work well though Morgan Stanley Share works does not stay connected. Budget categories are useful as are the dashboards. If you're looking for a Mint replacement, this is worth the price.",2024-08-08,4
"great overall but the connections to banks are annoying and disconnect. other than that it's great for organization of categories and automatic import of transactions. falls short on tracking stocks and investments properly so use something different for that. for spending and saving, minus the connection issues I'd give 5 stars",2024-07-29,4
more reports please,2024-07-28,4
"mint refugee, Monarch does pretty well at replicating all the things I used mint for, mainly net worth and spending tracking. My main point of criticism is that my accounts don't stay synced (may not all be on Monarch tbh)",2024-07-18,4
"Fast. Feature-rich. Great UX. Some missing features are allowing a cash credit in manual transactions (can currently only add to an account), showing the average difference in cash flows over time, quick-adding remaining split.",2024-07-16,4
"Not as good as Mint was, but they are dedicated and the app is accurate. Once I get used to it, I will like it maybe as much as Mint, but nostalgia has a way of paving over imperfections... RIP to the Goat. Miss you Mint.",2024-07-15,4
"Overall great app but the UI needs work. I'd like to see the gains and losses in percent on one line. If the security has extra text in it, the investment gain/loss percent will be in 2 lines. Super annoying to see that but overall good app.",2024-07-15,4
"Great app, takes patience to use properly, and for Canadian banks (CIBC) it requires you login everytime you want to update your transactions, but it reliably does so.",2024-07-14,4
"This app would be perfect if it had android widgets that showed the networth, balance and transactions.",2024-07-11,4
"its improving and becoming worth the money. rulemaking, due dates, and recurring transactions could still use some work",2024-07-10,4
"some of the connections need work, but works good enough otherwise",2024-07-08,4
So far so good. No scammy nonsense.,2024-07-04,4
A great multi functional money minder. Great graphical interface for cash flows. Cash categories are diverse. Lots of problems with subsidiary accounts like student loan and regional bank accounts decoupling. So far so good.,2024-07-03,4
"I'm coming over from Mint. I wish Monarch were free like Mint, obviously, but hopefully paying for it will prevent a repeat of the Mint disaster. I really don't want to switch again. Monarch has basically everything I need. I'm satisfied.",2024-07-01,4
It's very good except for the wonky design of Goals.,2024-06-30,4
"It's cool to have an accurate picture of where each of my budget categories are in almost real time, be aware of upcoming transactions, & set/evaluate goals whenever & where I am. My husband & I can each see where we are financially at any time, to help us decide on purchases.as we go. The one disappointment is that my credit institution's credentials need to be resubmitted about every week. a bit of a hassle.",2024-06-23,4
"other than the missing ability to see trends over time, a great replacement for mint",2024-06-20,4
"Coming from Mint, Monarch has been a decent replacement, albeit not free. Some connections are still missing, but otherwise the features are great for tracking spending and budgets.",2024-06-17,4
"Really love the program when it's working. A lot the connections to my accounts get dropped or don't update regularly. That part is frustrating. when everything is working as expected, it's my absolute favorite!",2024-06-14,4
"This has been a great replacement from Mint. Getting the Loans to be hidden from my transactions was needed to fix the Spending graph. However, Banking Integrations with various consumer financial permission apps has been great. Especially with how annoying Credit Union Authentication processes can be.",2024-06-09,4
"A very helpful tool that's straightforward and easy to customize to my needs, but with some issues. Monarch's account syncing leaves something to be desired coming from the app formerly known as Mint, but that's common for ever app I've tried. After accepting that, the biggest pain is how my balance history resets any time I have to disconnect and reconnect an account, even though the transaction history is there.",2024-06-05,4
"Pretty good. not Intuit, so that's cool. would be cool to update all your accounts when loading the app. But it's pretty current.",2024-06-03,4
"I love that you can customize the app the fit many different budget strategies. I would recommend looking at the YouTube videos about the product online before using the application. My primary gripe with the application is that it will not work with many types of financial institutions; particularly investment accounts and some HSA accounts so if you are serious about using the app connect al your accounts b4 the trial period runs out. In my opinion,for the cost, all of the features should work",2024-06-02,4
"By and large really love it but whenever I try to update a login on mobile it shows a little spinner forever and never gives me a chance to do anything, or even shows the plaid/etc logo (it works fine on desktop so I need to update using my computer)",2024-06-01,4
"If it allowed for quarterly and annual charges to be accounted for, it would be perfect",2024-05-23,4
"Almost perfect app! Some synching issues, but I do not blame it all on the app sometimes it is the banks. The one thing I wish it had is a way to project future account balance with recurring transactions. For example if I have $500 in my checking account on Monday July 1st and will get a salary check direct deposited on Friday July 5th of $200 and then will have a cell phone bill of $150 taken out on Saturday July 6th then my projected account balance for July 6th will be $550.",2024-05-19,4
so far good and intuitive ease of use. don't care for the ads for a pay app.,2024-05-19,4
don't sync well the accounts,2024-05-18,4
"moved from mint. only complaint is price and the fact that it has seemed to not learn my categories well. I'm constantly having to correct it, especially groceries vs shopping categories.",2024-05-17,4
Really love the app. I wish that inside the budget tab under goals I could change transactions to match that goals so I can more accurately reflect my savings inside my Budget.,2024-05-16,4
Overall excellent,2024-05-14,4
Pros: Seems to work very well and present info clearly Cons: more expensive than some other budget apps.,2024-05-11,4
Great customer experience and amazing platform. 4 stars due to consistent account disconnections for multiple different accounts. Have to reconnect often which is inconvenient.,2024-05-11,4
"Helpful, but has some bugs that prevent it from being fully compatible with all financial institutions.",2024-05-05,4
"Best replacement for Mint so far that connects to most Canadian institutions. Definitely a little slow to update sometimes. Manulife is showing as a valid account and it gets to the point of sending me a verification code successfully, but it has never connected successfully for setup. Wish I could add crypto quantities without using Coinbase. I just want to be able to include my holdings under my investment accounts using the values I have for each holding.",2024-04-24,4
"good option at monitoring your expenses. larger institutional connections than YNAB. my only issue, which I might not know how to do, is connecting recurrent payments to my national student loan such that I don't have to manually update how much I have left anymore. for manually entered debt you should be able to add a recurrent payment such that it deceased automatically.",2024-04-17,4
Please fix link to Primis Digital Bank,2024-04-15,4
So far very little issues. Some things don't automatically connect. Has more features than mint did but the important stuff it is pretty much the same functionally. Slight improvement.,2024-04-15,4
very nice app that let's me see an overview of my all my accounts and categorize my transactions history! it also helps me budget and notices trends in my money I don't think about,2024-04-15,4
solid app. a little annoying that the loan balance tracking isn't as consistent with random disconnects.,2024-04-15,4
Good UI.,2024-04-15,4
"Update: I don't know what changed but integrations are much better now. Only real nit is that when I reconnect to some accounts, it duplicates them. Original review: Mint's direct integrations were a lot more reliable and less of a pain than the Plaid-based ones Monarch uses. Might be time to sever ties and do your own api work. It's a real pain having most of my accounts disconnect every few days.",2024-04-14,4
"I like the app. It has excellent features for creating a budget and tracking all the expenses. The only reason why I only gave it four stars is because, with CIBC accounts (in Canada), it disconnects frequently, and I have to re-enter the credentials every day. If you fix this issue, it would be awesome. With the rest of the banks, it works fine.",2024-04-13,4
"Needs some optimization for mobile, some text items get cut off. But overall works great.",2024-04-02,4
"Not a perfect replacement for Mint, but the best I've come across.",2024-03-31,4
Monarch as a personal finance tool is excellent. Migrated from Mint. Already feeling like home. 4 star because the android mobile app has crashed for me few times once I added a manual account for cash transactions.,2024-03-31,4
"so far so good, I'll revisit this review in a couple months",2024-03-28,4
Featureset is great. Price though is unjustifiable high.,2024-03-27,4
Good replacement for Mint,2024-03-26,4
"next best thing after mint discontinued, which is a shame because mint was free & I'm paying for something that is second best. For example, rate at which my accounts refresh has a greater lag here than on mint. Second, some accounts were not able to be linked like on mint. on monarch the budget view shows budget amount and how much is left. The budget view on mint was nicer because it told me how much was spent out of the budgeted amount AND how much is left with a nice little gauge per expense",2024-03-23,4
Getting used to it after having to move from Mint.,2024-03-21,4
"App is a great replacement for Mint. The only thing I wish it would do was resync accounts automatically more frequently than 24 hours. Every 6 hours would be ideal. Also, adding credit scores would be a bonus. Managing accounts, categories, and rules is very intuitive, and the UX in many ways is better than Mint. All the free alternatives out there simply don't compare.",2024-03-16,4
"Overall useful, but needs transaction data for investment accounts.",2024-03-16,4
"so far, so good",2024-03-13,4
Excellent budgeting tool transaction tracking and investments too,2024-03-11,4
"Does the job well, clean interface. Regarding the website, loved the Sankey chart in beta. That's what convinced me to pay. Much prefer paying for it than seeing ads on an app with so much of my private info. Issues: Makes mistakes in classifying categories, identifying recurring expenses automatically etc. Hoping it'll get better at those things over time",2024-03-11,4
Let me edit the placement of the budget snapshot so it is higher on the home dashboard. It is currently fixed in place. I shouldn't have to hunt scroll for such a vital piece of information in a BUDGETING APP 🤦,2024-03-10,4
Needs widgets,2024-03-08,4
"I can from Mint which is being disabled, Zappa still a little bit primitive, but mostly serves my needs. Looking forward to seeing how it evolves over the next year once my first year investment in the app is up.",2024-03-07,4
Really good Canadian Banks integrations. Simple to use.,2024-03-07,4
"Great platform. However my only knock is I am unable to add Wealthsimple (Canada) to the platform. After 50 tries it connects, but does not display the accounts properly like it does banks or cards. This needs to be fixed asap!",2024-03-06,4
USAA doesn't play nice with Monarch but I'm beginning to think USAA doesn't like to play nice with anyone. I've tried a few different account integration platforms and Monarch seems to have the best connectivity success with all my accounts and nice tracking features.,2024-03-05,4
overall easy to use and understand the breakouts. however getting everything pulled in can be a but challenging given authentication.,2024-03-03,4
Wish it had more planning features but liking it so far.,2024-03-02,4
great for budgeting! wish the investment portfolio management and crypto management would come soon!,2024-03-02,4
"It's a really good app with lots of potential. It's still hard to justify the $100/yr price, but with the incremental improvements (and hopefully optimizations on the Android app), I believe it'll be the perfect app for personal finance.",2024-03-01,4
"Broad account and service connection support, and pleasant ux. Docked 1 star for some inaccurate reporting with investments.",2024-03-01,4
Needs ability to connect to billers for utilities credit cards and other bills that vary month to month,2024-02-29,4
"Could be good needs some touch up, the drop down menus only show half the words in a given selection. Example would be selecting recurring expenses and the drop down gives 8 choices that just say ""every""",2024-02-29,4
best one. tried them all,2024-02-25,4
"Transitioned to this APP after mint shut down. After trying many, this one is the most similar to mint, but comes at a high fee. Others pushed ads, and totals would not display in cents (would round totals). In the end, not perfect, consists of a fee, but better than many, therefore, I rate it a 4.",2024-02-22,4
"Still a bit buggy sometimes, but it's the best finance app I've used. Hopefully the bugs continue to get resolved in future updates.",2024-02-21,4
The best Mint alternative I have found with a few caveats. The budgeting feature does not let you budget for categories within a group and a group like Mint does; it's one or the other. Investment tracking is also mediocre with investment totals that don't match account balances.,2024-02-20,4
"Switched from Mint. Really like the app, but it is still missing an upcoming bills feature like Mint had to show credit card amounts due instead of only the full balance.",2024-02-16,4
"The price is steep so knocked a star off (would only be a half if it was allowed) of the review, otherwise fantastic money managing app!",2024-02-14,4
"Canadian user here. This is the best replacement for Mint I've found in terms of budgeting, detailed transactions, net worth + support for all my accounts. I had previously tried CreditKarma & YNAB, but they weren't geared to what I liked about Mint. UPDATE: Regular transaction syncing across the board (banks, credit cards, investments) could be better. Can take several days for transactions to show up in Monarch.",2024-02-12,4
wish they'd add credit score tracking,2024-02-11,4
just starting with the online and phone apps. working well so far.,2024-02-04,4
I really like how it keeps track of my spending and deposits. I really like this app,2024-02-04,4
"Great app for keeping track of your daily transactions and categorizing your expenses and know where your money is being used. As well, as some other useful features like setting up goals, budgets, even including other people like family members into your account(haven't tested it yet. I am really like it despite the high price of the membership. I am a previous user of Mint for a few years.",2024-02-02,4
"Pretty great overall, better than mint. Some issues with data import prevent me from giving this 5 stars, but I'm overall very happy with it.",2024-02-01,4
love it.! There are a few options I yearn for but overall A++!,2024-01-31,4
I'm still getting the hang of it but it seems more of a way to track than to actually budget.,2024-01-25,4
"The product is excellent, except financial institutions' connections - it's quite a mess - completely unstable.",2024-01-25,4
