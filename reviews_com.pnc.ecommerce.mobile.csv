"24 May 2025 It‚Äôs stopped working! Every time I click on it, I wait, and wait, and nothing happens. I opened Google Playstore and downloaded the latest update and PNC app still doesn't work.",2025-05-24,1
closed my account a day after I created it and refused to elaborate.,2025-05-24,1
Constantly freezes up my phone. it doesn't work well with the samsung fold 6,2025-05-23,1
horrible experience. spended 30 mins just to login with the correct data,2025-05-23,1
"app never lets me in the first time, always have to log in, get dumped out, close app, and reopen and log in again, heck of a way to treat your loyal customers... ü§î you offer online security advice but can't even make a working app... wow! priorities all messed up...",2025-05-23,1
buggy mess that constantly signs me out and turns off biometrics. it was also bad on iOS,2025-05-23,1
New mobile app will not let me log in,2025-05-23,1
Can't stand this bank or app. M&T all the way.,2025-05-23,1
"worst banking app. whenever I sign in it automatically signs me out and then I resign in and it works. when I make a mobile deposit and take a picture, as soon as I click the shutter to take the pic it signs me out then I go back in and it works fine. tried zelleing money from my business account for an expense and it just took me in circles verifying a phone number, then the email, then it never allowed me to proceed. ugh. I just hate the PNC app so much. rant over",2025-05-23,1
app is always freezing constantly have to install and uninstall ugh,2025-05-23,1
"The only thing consistent about this app, is that it consistently pisses everyone off. It's a janky PoS that crashes IMMEDIATELY every time you login, requiring at least one more login, possibly more. Absolute garbage. This is what happens when you push out updates for the sake of updates. Login doesn't work, biometrics don't work, mobile deposit barely works.... it's great.",2025-05-23,1
when it works its great unfortunately its down just about every morning,2025-05-23,1
"more updates, yet issues haven't been fixed....as soon as you log it app says your session has expired and logs you out. gotta log in sometimes 2 or 3 times to see your account.",2025-05-23,1
sucks,2025-05-23,1
one of the worst banking apps I have used. Has started to constantly crash especially when trying to do mobile deposit. has been like this for months,2025-05-22,1
keeps crashing when I log in,2025-05-22,1
"This app is very frustrating but since thsi is the bank I use, I'm stuck with it. It crashes all the time and sometimes I can even use it for paying bills or using Zelle. It really needs to be improved!",2025-05-22,1
"no ability to easily email or contact PNC in a non-real time way. let me send an email PNC, I'm not waiting on the phone for an hour to ask a one second question.",2025-05-22,1
Closing my account because of this app. it can't be worse.,2025-05-22,1
"horrible app and updates. everytime there is an update the biometrics don't work. you have to request enter password. in addition customer service cannot be done well from app. phone numbers, services etc. not done from app. very limited. biggest issue is every update they lock you out",2025-05-21,1
mobile deposit sucks always craching out,2025-05-21,1
"horrible app! constantly crashes! spoke with support... she told me it's because I need to uninstall the app, re install and then reset my phone... ummm no, yalls ""updates"" mess the app up EVERYTIME! stop being cheap and actually spent money on developing the app! and please üôè UPDATE the look of it! so outdated! makes me feel like I'm banking on an old Macintosh! *Update... She told me she isn't having any issues with it, well good for you...A LOT of people are!",2025-05-21,1
won't open,2025-05-21,1
Have had to log in twice for as long as I can remember just to view activity with this buggy app. Should devote more resources for the user instead of their execs. I've been with PNC for over 15 years and have seen minimal advances or rewards for the customer. Actually leaving this month for another bank with no fees who won't have requirements to house my money.,2025-05-21,1
This app used to work beautifully but for the last few months my husband and I both have the exact same issue on our own devices with our own individual logins. Every single time we log in it immediately tells us we have been logged out. Then to avoid having to manually type in our login information we have to close the app and relaunch it and it works correctly. I love PNC as a bank but they seriously need to step it up with their app.,2025-05-20,1
This app freezes and NEVER allow me to use PNC pay when I try to use the touchless feature. It NEVER let me pay with my phone. I have to always have to make sure I have my physical card to pay. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE fix this contactless feature.,2025-05-20,1
always have to uninstall and installed the app,2025-05-20,1
"STOP TURNING THE BIOMETRICS ON AND OFF! STOP OFFERING TO PEOPLE IF YOU CAN'T KEEP ON! GOES DOWN AT THE MOST INOPPORTUNE TIMES, CAUSING EVEN MORE CHOAS! NOW THEY CHANGED IT FROM FINGETPRINT TO FACIAL RECOGNITION. NOT EVERYONE HAS THOS FEATURE! P.O.S. APP! BUT I NEED IT. IM THINKING ALL THESE GREAT REVIEWS ARE EITHER AI OR BOUGHT.",2025-05-20,1
Logs me out after every action on Android.,2025-05-20,1
horrible,2025-05-20,1
doesn't always connect,2025-05-19,1
app is terrible logs you out constantly and requires multiple log in attempts before it will let you into your account. If you're looking for a modern banking experience stay away from PNC.,2025-05-19,1
mobile deposit is pretty much useless. crashes almost every time you take a picture of a check. app crashes when you sign in.,2025-05-19,1
app never works,2025-05-19,1
I always have to uninstall then reinstall the app to get Zelle to work properly. Please just put Zelle on the website I rather use my desktop!!!!!!!!!!,2025-05-19,1
always need to uninstall and reinstall. unreliable.,2025-05-19,1
I'm about to switch banks because this app is so disfunctional,2025-05-19,1
buggy trash,2025-05-19,1
Does not allow adding of external accounts to be used for credit card payments. Always have to login from computer. Is the ability to add external accounts ever going to be added? This app is virtually worthless to me. I see other posts of issues with this app. Do they just not care to fix issues. Other banking apps work fine!!!,2025-05-19,1
Keeps freezing and when I do sign in am error page pops up. So it doesn't allow me to sign in. I end up having to call just to find out my balance.,2025-05-19,1
"Lot of bugs, don't show the statement properly.",2025-05-19,1
"The PNC mobile app is probably one of the worst big name apps I've ever used. It crashes more often than I use it, constantly logging me out as I'm trying to log in - I'll put in my login info and when it takes me to the ""send code by text or call"" view and I select my option, it then logs me out instead. Or it'll just freeze. PNC should really hire actual mobile developers, it's not that hard to build a functional app. I'm ready to just move to Chase.",2025-05-19,1
Constant issues. Especially when trying to transfer funds out of PNC. It almost feels like it's not a coincidence.,2025-05-19,1
"Keeps crashing and not working for long periods of time without any update or warning to it's users. Update: Still crashes all the time. Asks me to set up biometrics, then when I use it, disables it for security reasons. I go to sign in with my password and it kicks me out saying I just signed out. Still a terrible app, I just have to use the PNC website all the time.",2025-05-18,1
way too much trouble when there's no bank to walk into!,2025-05-18,1
"The app has gotten progressively worse over the last couple of years. Every single time I launch the app, I sign in and it tells me that my session is expired and to log in again. That's fine but it's likely a straightforward fix on the backend to fix session managemen for the app. It also randomly signs me out while using the app if I switch between apps, or try to use a function like mobile deposit. I have a modern flagship phone and there is no reason for this level of performance problems.",2025-05-18,1
"used to love this app. now it crashes every time as soon as I log on. Have to go back in twice, EVERY SINGLE TIME!! I think this is the last straw for me and PNC all together.",2025-05-18,1
The app is randomly signing me out. Whatever update was done to the app was not necessarily an upgrade. It's annoying to have to sign in multiple times within minutes.,2025-05-18,1
zelle is not working.,2025-05-18,1
"Terribly ""fiddly"" even 1 wrong PIN locks you out of Zelle",2025-05-18,1
I have change passwords EVERY time.,2025-05-17,1
ridiculous I just use online,2025-05-17,1
won't load,2025-05-17,1
always has issues,2025-05-17,1
incredibly buggy every time i sign in it signs me out. if i do mobile check deposit it signs me out. so frustrating,2025-05-16,1
India bargain barrel outsourced or offshored developers. Biometric de-enrolls after every logon. App crashes when you try to process a mobile deposit frequently. Is QA that hard? It really isn't.,2025-05-16,1
"Signs me out after signing in, never remembers the biometrics, or saves user id, Been like this for several years now",2025-05-16,1
"This app no longer works with OneUI 7. When trying to make a deposit, it doesn't open the camera. It only gives a black screen and then eventually says the app is not responding. When the deposit function used to work the app was still buggy. It would frequently give a ""service unavailable, try again later"" error.",2025-05-16,1
"Constantly crashes, used to be great. Worthless now.",2025-05-16,1
app not working. will not download,2025-05-16,1
basically broken. always have to log in twice.,2025-05-16,1
"I use this app frequently, there is some snag with the login process. Currently, it will let me log in, tell me my session is expired, and log me out. I can then log back in. Log out and go back in later - same problem. Very annoying. I have cleared cache, cleared cache and memory - no change. Uninstalled and reinstalled. No change. I know at least one other person having this issue. Sad, I am actually considering changing banks because this app performs so poorly and no one cares.",2025-05-16,1
this app is so buggy it should be featured in an Indiana Jones film.,2025-05-16,1
"I haven't got paid a day or two early at all with this bank, i have friends who bank with chime. etc that get paid Wednesdays.",2025-05-16,1
"The biometric login always glitches. When you sign in, it immediately signs you out and makes you log in again. Real buggy app",2025-05-16,1
app constantly logs you out,2025-05-15,1
The app is very very buggy. currently it gives a app not responding message every 20 seconds even though it's actually working. previously I've had issue with Zelle integration also,2025-05-15,1
"My local branch is the worst. They removed the walk-up ATM machine and recently stopped making replacement debit cards. I called to initiate a dispute on my checking account and the CSR was rude. It was a PITA when I switched banks to PNC. I would leave PNC, except I don't want to go through all that pain again!",2025-05-15,1
Garbage app. It's down all the time. My other bank (Woodforest) has zero issues and it's a smaller bank.,2025-05-15,1
"The application keeps losing biometric settings. It also logs me out right after logging in or says service is unavailable. But after one or more retries, I can usually log in. There are no issues logging in via a browser. I've tried troubleshooting by clearing the cache, clearing storage, restarting the app, restarting the phone, uninstalling and reinstalling the application, etc. Nothing helps.",2025-05-15,1
"Every time I deposit a check, the app shuts down, and I don't know if it was deposited or not. Then I log into the app and make the deposit again, and it tells me I'm depositing the same check. It is so annoying!",2025-05-15,1
Every time I login I'm immediately logged out. I have to login twice every time I need to use this app. Please fix it!!,2025-05-15,1
"constantly signs me out. forgets my biometric settings, refuses to recognize Google password manager, and is a wall garden to zelle usage for PNC customers app has my rethinking my banking choice",2025-05-15,1
mobile deposit always causes a forced exit. what's up?,2025-05-15,1
Not good.. this app used to be great but any more it never works!!! I constantly have to sign in twice before I can use the app. it keeps forgetting my finger print and won't allow me to save my id for quicker log in. I see others having the same problem.. some people feel they are being hacked and have uninstalled. what is going on? where is the support?,2025-05-15,1
hate it cant log in,2025-05-14,1
tired of biometrics randomly not working and having to come up with yet another freaking password.,2025-05-14,1
"Continually freezes. Does not read stamped endorsements well - even those issued by PNC. At times, it just shuts down. I recently received a pop-up while using the app. It froze in the middle of doing the evaluation. At the beginning of May, this App was not available because it was to be updated. It's worse. First, upon entering the login information, it wouldn't login. Second. every few minutes, it freezes making it necessary to close and log back in. - very frustrating",2025-05-14,1
"When are you gonna fix this stupid app? Every time I sign in, it immediately logs me out and makes me do it again. I've enabled biometrics every time I actually manage to log in but the next time I try it disables it. Half the time I log in, balances and account history aren't available. What's the function of this app supposed to be if nothing ever works?",2025-05-14,1
Not allowing screenshots is stupid and annoying. there's no reason for it.,2025-05-14,1
Constantly have problems when the app launches. Biometric scan frequently doesn't work or the app just signs me out all the time even with daily use.,2025-05-14,1
"I can only successfully login about 10% of the time. The rest of the time ""service is temporarily unavailable"". Also the app frequently crashes in the middle of check deposit.",2025-05-14,1
always stalls or freezes,2025-05-14,1
please don't bank with them save yourself the headache. a lot of the time it will be unavailable. the pending transactions would take days to clear. overdraft even when you have overdraft protection set up,2025-05-14,1
app must be broken because every single time I go to log in I have to log in twice the first time I'm immediately logged out saying I timed out and need to log back in despite the fact that I literally just logged in this app keeps having problems and this keeps happening no matter how many updates they do,2025-05-14,1
this needs fixed ASAP ! since the update i cant even login without the app freezing. i wven tried unintalling and reinstalling the app. still not working,2025-05-13,1
pesimo banco,2025-05-13,1
"I'm trying to send money by zell to my girl, and now the app is telling me I've never sent money to her before. It seems a little tough to trust. Stopped working when I did an o/s upgrade on my phone. They fixed it finally. I was using the website and that wasn't updated in real time, and that messed me up.",2025-05-13,1
can't get to open,2025-05-13,1
app is awful,2025-05-13,1
"The app crashes when depositing checks, now. Or it takes the picture but signs you out and doesn't deposit anything. Usually this app is fine, though. The latest update just screwed this part up, I guess.",2025-05-13,1
"The biometric authentication on the PNC Mobile app for Android is deeply frustrating. It consistently requires 2-3 login attempts before granting access. I've never had issues with Chase or other apps with biometric auth. Even worse, after three failed attempts, the app un-enrolls me from fingerprint login, forcing a re-enroll. This issue is so aggravating that I'm probably closing my account and switching banks. Please address this critical flaw.",2025-05-13,1
absolutely terrible not use the friendly at all,2025-05-13,1
This app is NO Good....when you log in it takes forever to boot in....thats even if it boots in...everytime you log in it says the app is not responding. I kept trying and trying. it takes 5 minutes to even log in and that is if it does respond. I had to remove app and download again just to use zelle.to send money to my mom I have to keep deleting the app and re-downloading just to use it...,2025-05-12,1
"if I could rate this lower, I would. this app has had issues with 2fa login and/or biometric login for at least a month. texts you the code, copy/paste to app then it logs you out. kicks you out to main login where you have to reenter your credentials then get another code. if you're lucky, it will sign you in the 2nd time. then it asks you if you want to enroll in biometric login (every time despite already setting it up).",2025-05-12,1
"This app is terrible, I can't deposit a check, it keeps logging me out. Doesn't the bank realize that the app has a problem, don't they read the reviews?",2025-05-12,1
freezes,2025-05-12,1
The app lets me sign in and then proceeds to immediately sign me out every single time I open the app. I have to sign in a second time every time I want to use the app. They're always under maintenance as well so what's the point of having the app if I never get to use it?,2025-05-12,1
it won't let me sign in when I do sign in it tells me that my sign in his timed out.,2025-05-12,1
no good,2025-05-12,1
"I set this app up to use my fingerprint to log in specifically because I didn't want to have to remember yet another password. Yet, the app will periodically disregard biometric login and force you use a password. Course, if you don't remember it, you have to go through a whole dog and pony show to reset it. Last 8 digits of your card, last 4 of your SSN, your PIN - twice - AND the answer to a security question. What's the point of biometrics if you're going to force people to do this?",2025-05-12,1
"Update: Biometrics issue STILL THERE! THIS IS INSANE!!! __________________________ Buggiest app ever! -Checking your balance - maintenance -Trying to start the app: biometrics off. -Entering my password: forever loading (after the biometrics turned off!) -biometrics turnes off by itself every once in a while, especially after the update. Still worst app notifications out of ALL banks in the world! BIOMETRICS DOESN'T WORK!!! It's on!!!",2025-05-11,1
keeps crashing on mobile deposit,2025-05-11,1
"This app has been messed up since the update. I login and it says thank you for visiting, and logs me out. I try logging in a second time and it claims the app is being worked on logs me out. I have to then sign in a third time just to gain access to app. Gave a two star because once I can actually login it's fine. ****Edit Version**** After months of not properly allowing me to log in, I have resulted in dropping the stars to 1 star. What is the point in having an app that you cannot log into.",2025-05-11,1
"This app sucks. Biometrics doesn't work. Auto fill doesn't work. I have to manually enter user name and password. Also , remember id doesn't work. Their help support was useless and after 5 encounters said "" we don't know what the problem is"" . They need to hire some competent programmers. This app just keeps getting worse and worse and worse and their help and support is probably the worst I've ever encountered.",2025-05-11,1
I hate this bank too many strictions you can't do anything in the middle of the night because they're posting this bank sucks,2025-05-11,1
There's always something wrong with this app,2025-05-11,1
extremely disappointed. this use to be the bestonline banking system. it has become nothing but problemartc. i do NOT recommend this banking system to anyone. complete disappointment. don't fall for it like I did. go somewhere else,2025-05-11,1
PNC I have never seen a bank app so bad or a bank so bad if you are thinking of pnc think again they do not live up to there promises to customers,2025-05-10,1
"Makes me log in again every single time. Biometrics never work, save user name/password turns itself off. Half the time I log in an d it says service unavailable.",2025-05-10,1
horrible app slow to use,2025-05-10,1
"This app used to work well, but for some reason it can no longer retain my biometrics settings. Also, it logs me out every time it sends an MFA Auth Code. I literally have to login 3 times every time I want to use the app. Please fix this and I will update my review.",2025-05-09,1
"Requires a SMS passcode *every single time I open the app.* The login process is also completely screwed up, with the password field locking up and preventing interaction, disabling biometrics randomly, etc. The app freezes and crashes constantly. It is incredible that a banking app used by millions is this poorly developed.",2025-05-09,1
The app used to work really well. Now it is awful. I have to log in twice back to back. It logs me out as soon as I submit my credentials. The mobile deposit is giving errors. Very frustrating üò°.,2025-05-09,1
"every time I sign in, it says signing you out and then I need to do it a second time. this has been happening for months now and it's very annoying",2025-05-09,1
poorly designed app and experience,2025-05-09,1
"I used to love my app. However, recently, my Low Cash Mode decisions are not available via the app and can only be accessed using the push notification that has been sent to my device. After that has been viewed or changes made, that page cannot be viewed again, because it is not available through the app now and the notification is gone.",2025-05-09,1
never updates correctly and annoying to navigate through.,2025-05-09,1
"12/11/22 Incredibly fickle app. Works well at times and then doesn't work at all. Super frustrating. Edit: 3/21/24 Not much has changed. Edit: 4/27/25 Why does the app open normally then say it's unavailable? Sign in and it reverts to unavailable again? Edit: 5/9/25 Sign in, app signs me out, displays sign in window. Sign in and app opens, displays signed out message. Can't see accounts. Like this for weeks. App is garbage, dev sucks. üëéüëé",2025-05-09,1
"No I didn't turn off biometrics but please do it for me at least once a day. Ive forced stopped, cleared cach, updated, uninstalled, reinstalled and even when I got a new phone the same thing happens. Also why is it next to impossible to login before 8a?",2025-05-09,1
"I used to love this app. hasn't worked for months. some update won't let me open it anymore. I have done an uninstall twice and reinstall to no avail. I'm on a new samsun galaxy note phone too. and because this doesn't work, I can't use Zelle cash app as it want to open this app to use Zelle. üòëüò°",2025-05-08,1
"This version is very buggy. When I open the app after closing it earlier it logs me out and says my session has ended log back in, but that's exactly what I just did.",2025-05-08,1
App crashes and places you back to the log in screen when you take the second photo of a paper check. Using mobile deposit the second time works. Still broken as of 5/08/2025,2025-05-08,1
Thiss bank is the worst bank I've ever had from the bottom to the top the people working here are clueless and outright rude,2025-05-08,1
always issues,2025-05-08,1
The login keeps resetting and turning off the biometric login. I have to set it up again every time I login. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app several times and it has the same issue.,2025-05-08,1
App logs me out whenever I'm in the middle of mailing a check deposit. It takes at least 2 tries before the transaction is successful.,2025-05-08,1
"This is the most garbage app I have used. Constantly removing my use of biometrics, asking me I would like to use them, only to disable the use again. Signing me out as soon as I log in. Requiring me to uninstall and reinstall roughly once every two or three months. Absolutely unacceptable for a banking app.",2025-05-08,1
check deposit crashes after 2nd photo. random crashes. service not available messages. log in takes two attempts to work. bad app,2025-05-08,1
1. When I open the app it says I am logged out of my accounts and I end up having to close the app and reopen it. 2. Logging in with fingerprint biometrics intermittently doesn't work and I have to enroll again PLEASE fix these bugs because I login to my account daily.,2025-05-08,1
Glitchy,2025-05-08,1
APP IS NOT WORKING TO LOCK CARD,2025-05-08,1
"so the app is decent, but every two/three days biometric stops working. I have to re-enroll in it again and again and again. i have cleared the cache, cleared storage, uninstalled and reinstalled the app nothing works. Lately, it would sign in but then kick me out again. Terrible experience.",2025-05-07,1
This app signs me out every time I sign in wether it's with biometric sign or or with my password! I have to sign in 2 times everyday and it turns off fingerprints sign in. Fix this app. I never had problems when it was BBVA but since PNC took over I have problems all the time I sign in.,2025-05-07,1
Updated from my last review. Stopped working. Won't even open. Stuck on the PNC icon opening page. Have to use the online website to get my information.,2025-05-07,1
App crashes a lot lately. Very unreliable. 4/14/25 Upgraded phone to Android 15/OneUI 7. App still crashing when taking photo of back of check for deposit. 5/7/25 App crashed/froze trying to retake the photo of the front of a check. Please fix your app!,2025-05-07,1
"This app has always been clunky and I've experienced many of the same issues other users have (not saving biometric login, app crashes when taking photo of deposit, etc.). Following the update to their ""new banking platform"", the app gets hung up on the launch screen. I've reinstalled the app, restarted my phone, launched it over a dozen times, and it's just not functional. Time to find a new bank...",2025-05-07,1
"app is so bad that I'm leaving PNC altogether. Immediately signs you out upon a successful login, essentially making you log in twice. Biometrics is constantly getting disabled on its own. And then the app has the audacity to ask you to set up biometrics right after they unexpectedly disabled it. Closing the account I've had for years and moving to TD. see ya",2025-05-06,1
This app crashes or not working 90% of the time,2025-05-06,1
"This app continually closes or boots me out. it also says my credentials are not correct when they are. When trying to deposit checks, it glitches and does not complete the process.",2025-05-06,1
FIX YOUR APP,2025-05-06,1

The app will not remember biometrics and you also have to sign in twice every time before you're able to get in.,2025-05-06,1
"Update: Over a year later, and this app is still just as clunky as before. However, now it's managed to become less reliable. I can't even manage to make a mobile deposit now. I've been a PNC customer for a very long time, but this app is making me seriously consider switching banks. Frustrating how clunky the log in process is. Another update: Still a really, really bad app. Pretty sad, PNC.",2025-05-05,1
Hate this app! It's so hard to use. Wells Fargos mobile banking is much easier and very direct. I feel like I have to go through a maze on this app just 7 find out my account information.,2025-05-05,1
Can't log on for many days now,2025-05-05,1

Just got this acct a few days ago. Deposited a nice size check now it won't let me use ANY of the methods they boast abt to resurrect my money. üò° Then it asked me to verify a transaction using a phone number that I don't know and that is not even connected to my acct. This is trash,2025-05-05,1

I'm extremely disappointed with the PNC app. It feels like being stuck in the past. Why even have an app if you can't pay your credit card from another bank through it? I have to use a computer for something as basic as this. Very disappointed in the developers‚Äîbig thumbs down.,2025-05-02,1
this app hasn't worked for at least a week for me,2025-05-02,1
I don't want to do updates. It makes it harder to get into and messes things up. Stop doing it on mine!,2025-05-02,1
The worst banking app there is. This platform cannot even perform simple arithmetic which led to my account being overdrafted. It said my available balance was greater against my expenses and there has not been any transaction activity for the past 3 days then the next day it suddenly goes negative. I cannot fathom a banking app that cannot even do simple math and ends up having the audacity to overdraft my account and charge me 36 dollars as a fee. This banking app is faulty and misleading.,2025-05-02,1
Bank sucks,2025-05-02,1
"The unusability of this app will be a not-insignificant part of me leaving PNC as my bank.

It logs you out constantly, you have to restart things like depositing a check over and over because of glitches. Even getting your routing and account numbers is inconvenient. Not that you have a choice if you bank with PNC, but I would never recommend this app.",2025-05-01,1

Hey PNC. Did you hit your head when making this app. absolutely trash. stop logging me out. stop making re type my password . that's what biometric is for. Stop making me enter an email when I have an account. Do better.,2025-04-30,1
garbage app is broken. this app is constantly logging me out after I've changed screens on my Android phone for less than 3 seconds and that used to not be the case. I'm constantly having to find my credentials and poke that back in and re-enable biometric access when for years. that's the only way I've been accessing. this phone is with my fingerprint so what's going on?,2025-04-30,1

She told me she isn't having any issues with it, well good for you...A LOT of people are!",2025-05-21,2
won't open,2025-05-21,2
Have had to log in twice for as long as I can remember just to view activity with this buggy app. Should devote more resources for the user instead of their execs. I've been with PNC for over 15 years and have seen minimal advances or rewards for the customer. Actually leaving this month for another bank with no fees who won't have requirements to house my money.,2025-05-21,2
This app used to work beautifully but for the last few months my husband and I both have the exact same issue on our own devices with our own individual logins. Every single time we log in it immediately tells us we have been logged out. Then to avoid having to manually type in our login information we have to close the app and relaunch it and it works correctly. I love PNC as a bank but they seriously need to step it up with their app.,2025-05-20,2
This app freezes and NEVER allow me to use PNC pay when I try to use the touchless feature. It NEVER let me pay with my phone. I have to always have to make sure I have my physical card to pay. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE fix this contactless feature.,2025-05-20,2
always have to uninstall and installed the app,2025-05-20,2
"STOP TURNING THE BIOMETRICS ON AND OFF! STOP OFFERING TO PEOPLE IF YOU CAN'T KEEP ON! GOES DOWN AT THE MOST INOPPORTUNE TIMES, CAUSING EVEN MORE CHOAS! NOW THEY CHANGED IT FROM FINGETPRINT TO FACIAL RECOGNITION. NOT EVERYONE HAS THOS FEATURE! P.O.S. APP! BUT I NEED IT. IM THINKING ALL THESE GREAT REVIEWS ARE EITHER AI OR BOUGHT.",2025-05-20,2

horrible,2025-05-20,2
doesn't always connect,2025-05-19,2
app is terrible logs you out constantly and requires multiple log in attempts before it will let you into your account. If you're looking for a modern banking experience stay away from PNC.,2025-05-19,2
mobile deposit is pretty much useless. crashes almost every time you take a picture of a check. app crashes when you sign in.,2025-05-19,2
app never works,2025-05-19,2
I always have to uninstall then reinstall the app to get Zelle to work properly. Please just put Zelle on the website I rather use my desktop!!!!!!!!!!,2025-05-19,2
always need to uninstall and reinstall. unreliable.,2025-05-19,2
I'm about to switch banks because this app is so disfunctional,2025-05-19,2
buggy trash,2025-05-19,2
Does not allow adding of external accounts to be used for credit card payments. Always have to login from computer. Is the ability to add external accounts ever going to be added? This app is virtually worthless to me. I see other posts of issues with this app. Do they just not care to fix issues. Other banking apps work fine!!!,2025-05-19,2
Keeps freezing and when I do sign in am error page pops up. So it doesn't allow me to sign in. I end up having to call just to find out my balance.,2025-05-19,2
"Lot of bugs, don't show the statement properly.",2025-05-19,2
"The PNC mobile app is probably one of the worst big name apps I've ever used. It crashes more often than I use it, constantly logging me out as I'm trying to log in - I'll put in my login info and when it takes me to the ""send code by text or call"" view and I select my option, it then logs me out instead. Or it'll just freeze. PNC should really hire actual mobile developers, it's not that hard to build a functional app. I'm ready to just move to Chase.",2025-05-19,2
Constant issues. Especially when trying to transfer funds out of PNC. It almost feels like it's not a coincidence.,2025-05-19,2
"Keeps crashing and not working for long periods of time without any update or warning to it's users. Update: Still crashes all the time. Asks me to set up biometrics, then when I use it, disables it for security reasons. I go to sign in with my password and it kicks me out saying I just signed out. Still a terrible app, I just have to use the PNC website all the time.",2025-05-18,2
way too much trouble when there's no bank to walk into!,2025-05-18,2
"The app has gotten progressively worse over the last couple of years. Every single time I launch the app, I sign in and it tells me that my session is expired and to log in again. That's fine but it's likely a straightforward fix on the backend to fix session managemen for the app. It also randomly signs me out while using the app if I switch between apps, or try to use a function like mobile deposit. I have a modern flagship phone and there is no reason for this level of performance problems.",2025-05-18,2
"used to love this app. now it crashes every time as soon as I log on. Have to go back in twice, EVERY SINGLE TIME!! I think this is the last straw for me and PNC all together.",2025-05-18,2
The app is randomly signing me out. Whatever update was done to the app was not necessarily an upgrade. It's annoying to have to sign in multiple times within minutes.,2025-05-18,2

India bargain barrel outsourced or offshored developers. Biometric de-enrolls after every logon. App crashes when you try to process a mobile deposit frequently. Is QA that hard? It really isn't.,2025-05-16,2
"Signs me out after signing in, never remembers the biometrics, or saves user id, Been like this for several years now",2025-05-16,2
"This app no longer works with OneUI 7. When trying to make a deposit, it doesn't open the camera. It only gives a black screen and then eventually says the app is not responding. When the deposit function used to work the app was still buggy. It would frequently give a ""service unavailable, try again later"" error.",2025-05-16,2

"I use this app frequently, there is some snag with the login process. Currently, it will let me log in, tell me my session is expired, and log me out. I can then log back in. Log out and go back in later - same problem. Very annoying. I have cleared cache, cleared cache and memory - no change. Uninstalled and reinstalled. No change. I know at least one other person having this issue. Sad, I am actually considering changing banks because this app performs so poorly and no one cares.",2025-05-16,2

app constantly logs you out,2025-05-15,2
The app is very very buggy. currently it gives a app not responding message every 20 seconds even though it's actually working. previously I've had issue with Zelle integration also,2025-05-15,2
"My local branch is the worst. They removed the walk-up ATM machine and recently stopped making replacement debit cards. I called to initiate a dispute on my checking account and the CSR was rude. It was a PITA when I switched banks to PNC. I would leave PNC, except I don't want to go through all that pain again!",2025-05-15,2
Garbage app. It's down all the time. My other bank (Woodforest) has zero issues and it's a smaller bank.,2025-05-15,2
"The application keeps losing biometric settings. It also logs me out right after logging in or says service is unavailable. But after one or more retries, I can usually log in. There are no issues logging in via a browser. I've tried troubleshooting by clearing the cache, clearing storage, restarting the app, restarting the phone, uninstalling and reinstalling the application, etc. Nothing helps.",2025-05-15,2
"Every time I deposit a check, the app shuts down, and I don't know if it was deposited or not. Then I log into the app and make the deposit again, and it tells me I'm depositing the same check. It is so annoying!",2025-05-15,2

mobile deposit always causes a forced exit. what's up?,2025-05-15,2
Not good.. this app used to be great but any more it never works!!! I constantly have to sign in twice before I can use the app. it keeps forgetting my finger print and won't allow me to save my id for quicker log in. I see others having the same problem.. some people feel they are being hacked and have uninstalled. what is going on? where is the support?,2025-05-15,2
hate it cant log in,2025-05-14,2
tired of biometrics randomly not working and having to come up with yet another freaking password.,2025-05-14,2
"Continually freezes. Does not read stamped endorsements well - even those issued by PNC. At times, it just shuts down. I recently received a pop-up while using the app. It froze in the middle of doing the evaluation. At the beginning of May, this App was not available because it was to be updated. It's worse. First, upon entering the login information, it wouldn't login. Second. every few minutes, it freezes making it necessary to close and log back in. - very frustrating",2025-05-14,2
"When are you gonna fix this stupid app? Every time I sign in, it immediately logs me out and makes me do it again. I've enabled biometrics every time I actually manage to log in but the next time I try it disables it. Half the time I log in, balances and account history aren't available. What's the function of this app supposed to be if nothing ever works?",2025-05-14,2
Not allowing screenshots is stupid and annoying. there's no reason for it.,2025-05-14,2
Constantly have problems when the app launches. Biometric scan frequently doesn't work or the app just signs me out all the time even with daily use.,2025-05-14,2
"I can only successfully login about 10% of the time. The rest of the time ""service is temporarily unavailable"". Also the app frequently crashes in the middle of check deposit.",2025-05-14,2
always stalls or freezes,2025-05-14,2
please don't bank with them save yourself the headache. a lot of the time it will be unavailable. the pending transactions would take days to clear. overdraft even when you have overdraft protection set up,2025-05-14,2
app must be broken because every single time I go to log in I have to log in twice the first time I'm immediately logged out saying I timed out and need to log back in despite the fact that I literally just logged in this app keeps having problems and this keeps happening no matter how many updates they do,2025-05-14,2
this needs fixed ASAP ! since the update i cant even login without the app freezing. i wven tried unintalling and reinstalling the app. still not working,2025-05-13,2

"I'm trying to send money by zell to my girl, and now the app is telling me I've never sent money to her before. It seems a little tough to trust.

app is awful,2025-05-13,2
"The app crashes when depositing checks, now. Or it takes the picture but signs you out and doesn't deposit anything. Usually this app is fine, though. The latest update just screwed this part up, I guess.",2025-05-13,2
"The biometric authentication on the PNC Mobile app for Android is deeply frustrating. It consistently requires 2-3 login attempts before granting access. I've never had issues with Chase or other apps with biometric auth. Even worse, after three failed attempts, the app un-enrolls me from fingerprint login, forcing a re-enroll. This issue is so aggravating that I'm probably closing my account and switching banks. Please address this critical flaw.",2025-05-13,2
absolutely terrible not use the friendly at all,2025-05-13,2
This app is NO Good....when you log in it takes forever to boot in....thats even if it boots in...everytime you log in it says the app is not responding. I kept trying and trying. it takes 5 minutes to even log in and that is if it does respond. I had to remove app and download again just to use zelle.to send money to my mom I have to keep deleting the app and re-downloading just to use it...,2025-05-12,2
"if I could rate this lower, I would. this app has had issues with 2fa login and/or biometric login for at least a month. texts you the code, copy/paste to app then it logs you out. kicks you out to main login where you have to reenter your credentials then get another code. if you're lucky, it will sign you in the 2nd time. then it asks you if you want to enroll in biometric login (every time despite already setting it up).",2025-05-12,2
"This app is terrible, I can't deposit a check, it keeps logging me out. Doesn't the bank realize that the app has a problem, don't they read the reviews?",2025-05-12,2
freezes,2025-05-12,2
The app lets me sign in and then proceeds to immediately sign me out every single time I open the app. I have to sign in a second time every time I want to use the app. They're always under maintenance as well so what's the point of having the app if I never get to use it?,2025-05-12,2
it won't let me sign in when I do sign in it tells me that my sign in his timed out.,2025-05-12,2
no good,2025-05-12,2
"I set this app up to use my fingerprint to log in specifically because I didn't want to have to remember yet another password. Yet, the app will periodically disregard biometric login and force you use a password. Course, if you don't remember it, you have to go through a whole dog and pony show to reset it. Last 8 digits of your card, last 4 of your SSN, your PIN - twice - AND the answer to a security question. What's the point of biometrics if you're going to force people to do this?",2025-05-12,2
"Update: Biometrics issue STILL THERE! THIS IS INSANE!!! __________________________ Buggiest app ever! -Checking your balance - maintenance -Trying to start the app: biometrics off. -Entering my password: forever loading (after the biometrics turned off!) -biometrics turnes off by itself every once in a while, especially after the update.

"This app has been messed up since the update. I login and it says thank you for visiting, and logs me out. I try logging in a second time and it claims the app is being worked on logs me out. I have to then sign in a third time just to gain access to app. Gave a two star because once I can actually login it's fine. ****Edit Version**** After months of not properly allowing me to log in, I have resulted in dropping the stars to 1 star. What is the point in having an app that you cannot log into.",2025-05-11,2
"This app sucks. Biometrics doesn't work. Auto fill doesn't work. I have to manually enter user name and password. Also , remember id doesn't work. Their help support was useless and after 5 encounters said "" we don't know what the problem is"" . They need to hire some competent programmers. This app just keeps getting worse and worse and worse and their help and support is probably the worst I've ever encountered.",2025-05-11,2

"Requires a SMS passcode *every single time I open the app.* The login process is also completely screwed up, with the password field locking up and preventing interaction, disabling biometrics randomly, etc. The app freezes and crashes constantly. It is incredible that a banking app used by millions is this poorly developed.",2025-05-09,2

The worst banking app there is. This platform cannot even perform simple arithmetic which led to my account being overdrafted. It said my available balance was greater against my expenses and there has not been any transaction activity for the past 3 days then the next day it suddenly goes negative. I cannot fathom a banking app that cannot even do simple math and ends up having the audacity to overdraft my account and charge me 36 dollars as a fee. This banking app is faulty and misleading.,2025-05-02,2

Not that you have a choice if you bank with PNC, but I would never recommend this app.",2025-05-01,2

garbage app is broken. this app is constantly logging me out after I've changed screens on my Android phone for less than 3 seconds and that used to not be the case. I'm constantly having to find my credentials and poke that back in and re-enable biometric access when for years. that's the only way I've been accessing. this phone is with my fingerprint so what's going on?,2025-04-30,2

"This app has become so unstable on my android phone. Biometrics seems to reset every time I login at this point. Sometimes when transferring money or mobile deposits, it will just log me out. Please stabilize this app so I don't have to switch banks.",2025-03-14,2
"App is great, but WHY TF can't I send money with Zelle on the website?? You don't ALWAYS have a phone on you in certain situations. I can send it in the app just fine, why TF can't you do it on the website? There's no option.",2025-03-13,2

This is app is very inconsistent and malfunctions almost regularly. Biometrics reset almost every other day Maybe once a week. Cardless codes never works when actually at the ATM. External bank has not worked in about a week. And it's the first time I am trying to set one up. Needs to learn how online banks are very efficient because this is not it.,2025-03-03,2
"App works okay for deposits and general information (as it should) but it frequently says the service is unavailable, but then I immediately try again and it opens. The biometrics are also annoying. It frequently says I haven't used it in a while (which is incorrect), then makes me go through the whole sin in process again. It's been this way for a while. PNC must not check their own app very often.",2025-03-03,2
This app is too slow. PNC have to work on it to get it update and faster. Local credit union with way less money have better working app. It constantly freezing and is not my phone because it happens in my wife cell too.,2025-03-02,2
The function to paste the verification code should be disabled.,2025-03-01,2
The app is garbage,2025-02-26,2
Ever since PNC has taken over my bank their mobile app has locked me out at least three times a year. It almost never remembers login preferences at least not for long. Customer support has rarely been helpful. They usually just have to force their way through. The worst thing is if you change your password through the app it doesn't always update the system so when you try to load on on a PC you're screwed as well. I can only hope it's as hard for a hacker to get to my money as it is me.,2025-02-20,2
The new update is terrible. For some reason I get 20 notifications for about an hour after making one purchase. It's very annoying as it makes me think my card is being charged multiple times or been hacked. Please fix this.,2025-02-18,2
You have to update every single month to use it. Can't even access my bank info without having to update it first. Tired of all the updates!!!!!,2025-02-15,2

"Functionality is generally very good (when everything works), however, the interface needs improvement. Why is there no dark mode option? The stark white background and light-colored text make the app difficult to read at times. I have downgraded my rating due to login issues.

The app is very slow and sometimes does not open.,2025-02-07,2
"Service is constantly down. Biometric login is available, yet every three logins, it forces you to reenter a password, and also needs a code to login every single time. Frustrating levels of security and inconsistent service when usually I just need to check my balance.",2025-02-07,2

When the app works it's great. But 8 out of 10 times it doesn't work.,2025-02-04,2
So annoying that the app wants to work when it wants to work. Don't understand why it will allow biometrics for a while and then it will take it out. Always have a hard time signing in when the biometrics are not allowed. Seems like some bugs to me!,2025-02-03,2

There is such a thing as being too secure that you're locked out of your account more times than you access it.,2024-12-31,2
"This app is extremely unreliable when you need it to be. Sometimes I'm met with ""services unavailable"" for no reason. My biometrics settings are reset probably once weekly.

The updates are to ""enhance user experience"" but when the app doesn't work half of the time what's the goal here? ""Service is unavailable"". That's the BEST way to describe this app. People use mobile banking. For as much money as PNC has you would think that maybe they'd have an app that's worth something.",2024-12-23,2
I cant figure out how to get it on my home screen,2024-12-22,2
Sucked,2024-12-21,2
Not so good anymore. Even with Biometrics you still have to go through hoops to login. The latest upgrade caused me to reboot my phone four times and finally had to remove PNC app and reinstall it,2024-12-21,2
Below average Random fees at abnormal times get transacted,2024-12-20,2
"The app is just really janky. I'm sure the bank is good, but with how inconvenient this app is it didn't take long for me to switch back to my old one.

Can't login 90% of the time from the app and have to go use a computer. It worked great for years but now hardly ever works.,2024-12-20,2
App is fine. However you can't paste your passwords into the password field on login. This effectively stops users from using complicated passwords generated in other apps like Bitwarden or LastPass. Not user friendly.,2024-12-20,2
The sign in fails almost everytime and you have to reselect the biometrics option.,2024-12-19,2
Is not working,2024-12-19,2
"There is a TON that I can say about PNC business banking. It's definitely not good. It's my opinion that certain business owners get loans instead of a line of credit on a card. Then, the fees are ridiculous for the threshold. The app is ok for the most part but to not be able to wire someone money from a business account is terrible to me.",2024-12-19,2
I keep having to re-enroll to use biometrics to many times. This is getting ridiculous. How about an update that doesn't keep doing that?,2024-12-18,2
When PNC sold out to whatever other company everything has gotten unbearable to use. It's an ok app for the worst bank. Only use if you want to give all your bank info to foreign conglomerates who manage multiple companies.,2024-12-17,2

"Consistently flakey, always changing. In the past, this app has had a variety of issues using the camera for check deposit. (That seems ok now.)

"The app has gotten progressively worse over the last couple of years. Every single time I launch the app, I sign in and it tells me that my session is expired and to log in again. That's fine but it's likely a straightforward fix on the backend to fix session managemen for the app. It also randomly signs me out while using the app if I switch between apps, or try to use a function like mobile deposit.

I've had the continued issue where I log into the mobile app it brings you to the initial page with your balance but then a pop up appears that says Signed out - and text saying that I have been signed out and will need to sign in again. I have to log in once again to be able to access and can THEN access my account. This issue has been happening for months. I have a Pixel phone and there are currently no updates available to fix this issue. Please advise. Thanks.,2025-04-16,3

"Reducing this from 4 to 3 stars. While this is a useful app, especially for bill pay, it's really quite sloppy. Most inexcusable: If you set up fingerprint authentication, after you exit the app or log off, you WILL find that the next time you access the app it will require that you log in (that's great so far) but upon logging in successfully it will say you've again been logged out. At that point, you cannot log in using your fingerprint... There's more, but I'll spare you...",2025-04-15,3

Lately I have had to re-establish my bimetrics every single time I login. I use my biometrics and it states I was logged out. Then once I log back in with password it asks if I want to re-enroll. Based on reading reviews this has been an issue and the app developer has done nothing to resolve the issue. It has been happening for months now.,2025-02-27,3

How much is PNC Bank worth?? You would think they would have a great app but this app is the most dysfunctional non-working app that I use regularly.

The app has not been opening going on almost a month now.,2025-01-18,3

"app is so bad that I'm leaving PNC altogether. Immediately signs you out upon a successful login, essentially making you log in twice. Biometrics is constantly getting disabled on its own.

Another update: Still a really, really bad app. Pretty sad, PNC.",2025-05-05,4

this app hasn't worked for at least a week for me,2025-05-02,4
I don't want to do updates. It makes it harder to get into and messes things up. Stop doing it on mine!,2025-05-02,4
The worst banking app there is. This platform cannot even perform simple arithmetic which led to my account being overdrafted. It said my available balance was greater against my expenses and there has not been any transaction activity for the past 3 days then the next day it suddenly goes negative. I cannot fathom a banking app that cannot even do simple math and ends up having the audacity to overdraft my account and charge me 36 dollars as a fee. This banking app is faulty and misleading.,2025-05-02,4
Bank sucks,2025-05-02,4
"The unusability of this app will be a not-insignificant part of me leaving PNC as my bank.

Not that you have a choice if you bank with PNC, but I would never recommend this app.",2025-05-01,4

garbage app is broken. this app is constantly logging me out after I've changed screens on my Android phone for less than 3 seconds and that used to not be the case. I'm constantly having to find my credentials and poke that back in and re-enable biometric access when for years. that's the only way I've been accessing. this phone is with my fingerprint so what's going on?,2025-04-30,4

"Biometrics login had quit working. logs you in, them out immediately. After you log in with password, it asks you too renroll in biometrics.

"Constantly forgets fingerprints for biometric auth. I can understand forcing password auth once a month, bimonthly or quarterly .. but weekly? Come on!! This app used to be better, recent updates for ""experience upgrades"" have made it worse.",2025-04-01,4

Biometrics consistently don't work. What's the point of offering it if it doesn't work every other time.,2025-03-31,4
"The app does not recognize you and you have to manually log in each time. every time I log in, it asks if I want to re-enroll in biometrics, which I say yes every time. it used to work just fine but ever since the latest updates, it does this.",2025-03-30,4

not user friendly,2025-03-30,4
"This app, every few days, disallows me to open it. I have to go to PNC login online and sign in again and only then can I open this app, which then makes me sign in a second time and I have to go through the process of allowing biometrics. This happens every 5 or 6 days and it's highly annoying and inconvenient. It's an issue that really needs to be fixed.",2025-03-30,4
Literally works only half the time,2025-03-29,4
This app had been great the last few years until recently when it's now constantly saying biometrics has been disabled.,2025-03-28,4

Friday banks closing in a few hours! I get a notification I need to verify my account! Well first of all I needed access to my money now and the bank decides to play games! Well I start logging in and it tells me too many tries so now I need to call the bank the person who answers is very unprofessional and after I get unset he hangs up! I now have been locked out and gotten sick over the weekend I go into the Web page and they continue to tell me I have my information wrong! I'm done with PNC,2025-03-24,4
does not work all the time,2025-03-24,4
"App was working great up until the last update? I'm assuming? It wasn't until the beginning of March once the FDIC notice popped up on the sign in screen that it started causing issues. Now my phone recognizes it as an unsafe app and asks if I want to be sharing my info with the app and once I sign in using my credentials, it pops up a window saying I've been logged out for inactivity and need to sign in again. It's so frustrating!!!",2025-03-23,4
Constantly need to redo password. Wasn't always like this. Seems maybe last update was terrible. Now the mobile deposit won't work!,2025-03-23,4
"Firstly: app never loads properly. The first time i open the app every day I have to manually kill the app from the taskbar and then reopen app for it to even load the login screen. The maintenance is often set during inconvenient hours; the biometric login option keeps resetting about once a week no matter how often i set it up again to login with fingerprint. Low rating is also for pnc itself. many issues over the years, most recent one is the check deposit option.",2025-03-23,4

International transaction fee is charged although paid through PayPal. Not happy.,2025-03-22,4

"After every Android security update, the biometrics stop working removing a star. The app is fine, when you can use it. The service has been ""temporarily unavailable"" for weeks.

Added 2 starts back...for now.",2025-03-20,4
"it's a good and useful banking app when working, but this login bug that's been going on for over a year is absurd. it's very frustrating",2025-03-20,4
2025 Update: This app is still terrible. it gets stuck in a log in/out loop all the time and I can't get in. 10/2020: PNC made me upgrade from the virtual wallet version to this version and mobile deposit does not work.. it can't figure out how to take the picture... Wonder if it has anything to do with the lawsuit against them for allegedly stealing their mobile deposit technology from USAA.. ü§î,2025-03-20,4

This is app is very inconsistent and malfunctions almost regularly. Biometrics reset almost every other day Maybe once a week. Cardless codes never works when actually at the ATM. External bank has not worked in about a week. And it's the first time I am trying to set one up. Needs to learn how online banks are very efficient because this is not it.,2025-03-03,4
"App works okay for deposits and general information (as it should) but it frequently says the service is unavailable, but then I immediately try again and it opens. The biometrics are also annoying. It frequently says I haven't used it in a while (which is incorrect), then makes me go through the whole sin in process again. It's been this way for a while. PNC must not check their own app very often.",2025-03-03,4
This app is too slow. PNC have to work on it to get it update and faster. Local credit union with way less money have better working app. It constantly freezing and is not my phone because it happens in my wife cell too.,2025-03-02,4
The function to paste the verification code should be disabled.,2025-03-01,4
The app is garbage,2025-02-26,4
Ever since PNC has taken over my bank their mobile app has locked me out at least three times a year. It almost never remembers login preferences at least not for long. Customer support has rarely been helpful. They usually just have to force their way through. The worst thing is if you change your password through the app it doesn't always update the system so when you try to load on on a PC you're screwed as well. I can only hope it's as hard for a hacker to get to my money as it is me.,2025-02-20,4
The new update is terrible. For some reason I get 20 notifications for about an hour after making one purchase. It's very annoying as it makes me think my card is being charged multiple times or been hacked. Please fix this.,2025-02-18,4
You have to update every single month to use it. Can't even access my bank info without having to update it first. Tired of all the updates!!!!!,2025-02-15,4

"Functionality is generally very good (when everything works), however, the interface needs improvement. Why is there no dark mode option? The stark white background and light-colored text make the app difficult to read at times. I have downgraded my rating due to login issues.

My zelle doesn't work,2025-02-07,4

The app is very slow and sometimes does not open.,2025-02-07,4
"Service is constantly down. Biometric login is available, yet every three logins, it forces you to reenter a password, and also needs a code to login every single time. Frustrating levels of security and inconsistent service when usually I just need to check my balance.",2025-02-07,4

When the app works it's great. But 8 out of 10 times it doesn't work.,2025-02-04,4
So annoying that the app wants to work when it wants to work. Don't understand why it will allow biometrics for a while and then it will take it out. Always have a hard time signing in when the biometrics are not allowed. Seems like some bugs to me!,2025-02-03,4
The pnc app crashes more often than it works.,2025-02-03,4

It works to log in and check your balance but it's not really reliable for anything beyond that. More than half the time the app will crash while trying to deposit a check and then each time you have to log back in and start again.

Seems to be an all right app although it's been a challenge to get used to or know how to do what I need to do in the app. I will say also, it sucks that you can use the virtual card for Google Pay as well as tap to pay but your not able to actually set a pin number so unable to access any cash back and that's DRIVING ME CRAZYZ also I am unable to find my full account and routing numbers anywhere on the app. So I'm so confused and no one knows anything of course üò≠üòûüò≠",2025-02-11,4
Not user friendly,2025-02-10,4
"Does everything I want it to do, as long as it's before midnight. Literally, I love being able to take care of everything I want to without going to an actual bank, but for some reason, after midnight, the app is useless. It won't load anything. It tells you features, like looking at your transaction history or transferring between accounts, are unavailable. I've been just dealing with it but it's 2am and all o did was try to log in and see my balance and that feature is unavailable.",2025-02-08,4
Very very inconsistent. Majority of the time the app. is not working or ready to go. REALLY REALLY NEEDS REWORKED,2025-02-06,4

The app is not effective and mostly hangs,2025-02-05,4
A nice app most of the time. I've noticed the app crashes often when trying to setup saving rules,2025-02-05,4

"About half the time it tells me service not available when I try to log in. It's good when it works, though.",2025-02-04,4
Difficult to navigate,2025-02-04,4
"The app glitches a lot, often saying I need to connect to a mobile network or to WiFi when I am connected to a secure WiFi server with excellent signal strength. I don't know what triggers this issue or how to resolve it but it's very frustrating. Glitches aside, the app is wonderful when it functions properly.",2025-02-04,4

"I'm trying to sign in to the app ,and it takes 5 to 8 times before it opens",2025-02-01,4
"Basic features work fine, but the login UX is frustrating. It removes biometric auth at least once a month (if not every other week). It will also sometimes freeze on login, or remove any credentials you've pasted in.",2025-02-01,4
"Biometrics fails. A month or two ago it stopped working and i had to enter my password. After entering the password i was prompted to set up biometrics. It would work once, then it would fall every other day, and i'd have to reset it. It worked for about a month and now has started failing failing again. I have credit card providers and other banks/ credit union that don't have this issue.",2025-02-01,4
Issue with Zelle. App freezes when using,2025-01-31,4
"Often logs me out immediately after logging me in. Often logs me out when I switch apps to check my security code. If I try to use Zelle and deny it permission to access my contacts it logs me out rather than allowing me to enter an email address directly. There is a workaround - I just need to click outside the permission access pop-up dialog box, but that is not intuitive. Locks me out of Zelle if I enter the wrong PIN in both the entry and confirmation boxes, which appear at the same time.",2025-01-31,4
so far so good,2025-01-31,4
Sucks pnc forces you to use their app to access Zelle. Often logs me out the moment I'm logged in. I like remote deposit.,2025-01-31,4

It works ok but i wish it was more reliable and smother.,2025-01-28,4
How much is PNC Bank worth?? You would think they would have a great app but this app is the most dysfunctional non-working app that I use regularly. Update: Now the biometrics is only available on occasion and I have to sign in via typing my password and after I do that it logs me out instantly and I have to do it again. It's frustratingly inconsistent.,2025-01-28,4
"The app crashed frequently, kicking me out when I'm in the middle of a deposit and frequently forgets my biometric selection, this resetting and making me login with my password.",2025-01-27,4
The biometric sign on is useless. It stops working about once a week.,2025-01-26,4
Biometrics used to work great but now the app never works with it and it just generally feels bloated.,2025-01-25,4
Easy to use,2025-01-25,4
"There's some features that my old credit union had on the banking app I miss. In general, the PNC app works well.",2025-01-25,4
This is an updated review. The app crashes often and I've given up on trying to use the Biometric login because it just doesn't work anymore. Not sure what happened but this app doesn't work anywhere near as well as it used to.,2025-01-24,4
Plain and confusing,2025-01-23,4
I'm giving it a 3 star because I'm always having to log in using my password instead of being able to use my fingerprint.,2025-01-23,4
My only issue is the zelle feature. I can send money but can't receive money that someone sent me.,2025-01-23,4
"Works well most of the time, but when really needed the app screws up. Some examples below: 1. Frequent maintenance outages at night. Kind of annoying if you're on the West Coast time zone. 2. Transfers fail in the app constantly which forces me to maintain a backup bank account. 3. Account balances are not visible some times. 4. Mobile check deposit does not work most times. Same check deposit works on another bank app. This app is what keeps me from making pnc my primary account.",2025-01-22,4
Some times network down .,2025-01-21,4
It works. Not a problem. But it forgets the biometric sign in once in awhile. And it's not easy to get to where you want to go. But it does work,2025-01-19,4
The app has not been opening going on almost a month now.,2025-01-18,4
The only good thing I like about the PNC Bank app is that immediately you can see how much is in your checking and savings account but trying to find your card number is difficult trying to find your routing number and your account number and your cards to turn on and off all super difficult too many steps.,2025-01-18,4
"Every other time I log into the app, my biometrics are shut off and I have to keep re-enabling them. Also why does the external transfer not work? This has been ""not working"" for over a month now....and I can't send money from one account to an account at a different bank...",2025-01-17,4
Hard to use. Phone number entry was awkward and had to enter multiple times for it to work,2025-01-16,4
"Compared to a different banking app that I've had, this one is a little more complicated to navigate.",2025-01-15,4
App keeps stopping use of biometrics every other sign in so I have to keep typing password. So App has dropped 2 stars from original review,2025-01-15,4

Awful for someone who has no idea what to do.,2025-01-06,4
"Good bank, pretty average app. The login experience is constantly goofing up between fingerprint and password. I can't use my password manager with the app because it pastes the values in the wrong fields. I really only use the app for sending Zelle payments and depositing checks. Those features work well enough.",2025-01-06,4
"Of my three banking apps, this is the only one that often doesn't accept my biometric sign-in. Frequently doesn't open at all, even when I attempt to sign in manually with my user ID and password. I've had to uninstall and reinstall on three different occasions in order to open the app. Very inconvenient when I need quick access to my account info.",2025-01-05,4
"It's ok. If you could lock and unlock your debit card from the app, that would probably bump the score up a bit.",2025-01-02,4
If it didn't decide to keep turning off biometrics I wouldn't care but it does randomly and it's so frustrating !,2025-01-01,4
"Conflicted on this app. It crashes nearly every time I use it or tells me the service is unavailable and then works immediately upon reload. The biometric sign in breaks nearly every time you have to manually log in. Which is often because the app crashes so much. My local credit union, which is a small company, has an app that is more functional than this thing. I do like that it has mobile deposit though and it works so it's a middle of the road experience.",2024-12-31,4
When you wanna use app. You have fingerprint senor on touch one time you had to many attempts. Force you put in password. If you put password in make sure you are spelling it right they will suspended your account. And make you change password get into account.,2024-12-31,4

"The app does what it is prescribed to do . Yet, too frequently it falls short of expectations. The sign in is the most frustrating.

Just don't be in a rush to get in the app as the afforementioned quirks are prevalent.",2024-12-20,4
Very useful app. However very complicated to use. Had staff member guide me through app,2024-12-20,4

App is sometimes very slow or times out when signing in,2024-12-19,4
"I would give a 5 star rating but i don't like the new fees that have been added in the banking system. I mean the bank uses our money on investments, making them money and now you penalize the same people who you barrow from, making more money. Another thing is i was in the low in my checking account with a charge pending that was gonna cause an overdraft. i had a check from work and I tried to do a mobile deposit but it wouldnt let me cause I was in the low causing an overdraft fee, not right",2024-12-19,4

"The app more often than not when I go to open it, I see the PNC logo but nothing becomes of it for like nearly a minute before my phone asks if I want to wait for the app to respond or close. If I hit close and then reopen it, I'm taken to the login page right away but only after waiting for the option to make the page close and reopen it. This needs to be fixed.",2024-12-13,4
"The only annoying part of the app, and the reason it is 3 and not 5 stars, is the feature that auto-disables biometrics. I have to turn biometrics on multiple times in a single day, even if I logged in 10 minutes prior.",2024-12-10,4

"The online experience is fine. It was award winning years ago. Now, the app is showing its age. I really don't like the ZELLE process. I had someone pay me through it and couldn't get the app to receive the payment. I also don't like the new system for coupons and promos. It sends you to a separate site and isn't integrated into the app like it once was.I would rate this higher if it was above average, but unfortunately, it's no longer.",2024-12-05,4

I was having a problem downloading the app and the Service agent came right in and helped me Thanksüòâüòâüòâ,2025-04-18,4
pretty easy and quick. sometimes a little buggy. but I enjoy how easy it is to send money to my friends and family. now I just need to figure out how to get my friends and family to send ME money ü§ë,2025-04-18,4
Back to being a decent app now that sign in has been fixed. The previous update would make me sign in twice. Thanks for correcting that issue.,2025-04-18,4
it's odd that after signing that have to sign again to get to Zelle. otherwise pretty darn smooth,2025-04-17,4
helpful,2025-04-17,4
Great App,2025-04-17,4
It's pretty fantastic when it works. The biometrics are kind of funky from time to time.,2025-04-15,4

keeps losing my biometric sign-on. locks me out of zelle on business account,2025-04-12,4
Seamless. Professional,2025-04-11,4
I may have had a sign in problem. but when I called customer service I was hooked up to an associate that walked me through the process to get it corrected. I am very happy with PNC,2025-04-11,4
it is a good banking service. I am trying their Zelle out,2025-04-10,4
sometimes biometrics makes the app crash,2025-04-10,4

"Has been easy to use and relatively smooth experience. can make all the transactions I need to including zelle, and between my accounts.",2025-04-09,4

I LIKE my Pn,2025-04-07,4
Tired of everything I kept messing up.I had to start from the beginning again and again.In reset.I think this is crazy.I shouldn't have to start and re do it all over again.I did it twelve times because I my finger slipped,2025-04-07,4

"it,s good really",2025-04-05,4
"seems to be a good and secure app for pnc except every time I sign in it tells me I've timed out and I will have to sign out and then sign in again. I do sign out correctly every time, even uninstalled and reinstalled but it did not help at all. I wonder if the app isn't signing me out right is my account secure or not.",2025-04-05,4

"Being taken outside the app for purchase payback offers is inconvenient. The UI before let me see specifically what offers are already attached to my card.

I never had any type of problem with PNC,2025-04-01,4
when it works it's as good as any,2025-04-01,4
"The PNC app is very useful, helpful, and easy to operate. You have access to all your account information as well as actions like check deposits, transfers, and sending/receiving money with Zelle.

Very good experience,2025-03-12,4
"Update: It seems they've fixed a lot of the problems the app had, especially the mobile deposit. It's still not perfect and has issues now and again with signatures on the back of checks but it's better. I'm not a fan of the new system where they converted checking accounts to virtual wallets. The virtual wallet system is much slower to update so I never know if anything has hit my checking account in the past half-day or so. The old checking account system, debits would show up immediately.",2025-03-12,4
"Great App. Easy to operate and understand. Love that Zelle is incorporated. I do wish that a little more information regarding each transaction would be given in the ""details"" but all in all a solid banking app.",2025-03-12,4
Very easy to use. But no extra benefits,2025-03-12,4

The app is starting to have major problems logging on. Every other time I try to log on it just loads forever and I need to restart my phone to get it to log in properly... Really a problem when I need to check my balance in a hurry or on the go,2025-03-02,4

Excellent,2025-02-28,4
It's user friendly after you get past all the security measures. They can be a pain but it's good to have them.,2025-02-27,4
Solid app that doesn't really crash and let's me do pretty much all banking I could need. Wish it allowed me to show my password when I try to log into make sure I didn't misspell it. Yep still works,2025-02-27,4

I just hate the PNC app so much. rant over",2025-05-23,5
app is always freezing constantly have to install and uninstall ugh,2025-05-23,5
"The only thing consistent about this app, is that it consistently pisses everyone off. It's a janky PoS that crashes IMMEDIATELY every time you login, requiring at least one more login, possibly more. Absolute garbage. This is what happens when you push out updates for the sake of updates. Login doesn't work, biometrics don't work, mobile deposit barely works.... it's great.",2025-05-23,5

won't open,2025-05-21,5
Have had to log in twice for as long as I can remember just to view activity with this buggy app. Should devote more resources for the user instead of their execs. I've been with PNC for over 15 years and have seen minimal advances or rewards for the customer. Actually leaving this month for another bank with no fees who won't have requirements to house my money.,2025-05-21,5
This app used to work beautifully but for the last few months my husband and I both have the exact same issue on our own devices with our own individual logins. Every single time we log in it immediately tells us we have been logged out. Then to avoid having to manually type in our login information we have to close the app and relaunch it and it works correctly. I love PNC as a bank but they seriously need to step it up with their app.,2025-05-20,5
This app freezes and NEVER allow me to use PNC pay when I try to use the touchless feature. It NEVER let me pay with my phone. I have to always have to make sure I have my physical card to pay. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE fix this contactless feature.,2025-05-20,5

I'm about to switch banks because this app is so disfunctional,2025-05-19,5
buggy trash,2025-05-19,5
Does not allow adding of external accounts to be used for credit card payments. Always have to login from computer. Is the ability to add external accounts ever going to be added? This app is virtually worthless to me. I see other posts of issues with this app. Do they just not care to fix issues. Other banking apps work fine!!!,2025-05-19,5

Or it'll just freeze. PNC should really hire actual mobile developers, it's not that hard to build a functional app. I'm ready to just move to Chase.",2025-05-19,5

Still a terrible app, I just have to use the PNC website all the time.",2025-05-18,5
way too much trouble when there's no bank to walk into!,2025-05-18,5
"The app has gotten progressively worse over the last couple of years. Every single time I launch the app, I sign in and it tells me that my session is expired and to log in again. That's fine but it's likely a straightforward fix on the backend to fix session managemen for the app. It also randomly signs me out while using the app if I switch between apps, or try to use a function like mobile deposit. I have a modern flagship phone and there is no reason for this level of performance problems.",2025-05-18,5

Not good.. this app used to be great but any more it never works!!!

"Continually freezes. Does not read stamped endorsements well - even those issued by PNC. At times, it just shuts down. I recently received a pop-up while using the app. It froze in the middle of doing the evaluation. At the beginning of May, this App was not available because it was to be updated. It's worse. First, upon entering the login information, it wouldn't login. Second. every few minutes, it freezes making it necessary to close and log back in. - very frustrating",2025-05-14,5
"When are you gonna fix this stupid app? Every time I sign in, it immediately logs me out and makes me do it again.

no good,2025-05-12,5
"I set this app up to use my fingerprint to log in specifically because I didn't want to have to remember yet another password.

Because it doesn't even work on my phone after one of the recent updates (I tried reinstalling and deleting the cache). Just a blank screen. So I have a useless app eating up all my battery. Yeah, no thanks. Your bank is awesome, your app not so much. And stop spying on me.",2025-04-24,5
Not a friendly app,2025-04-24,5

"Always simple, updated, and secure. Edit: This used to be my experience with the app, but now, logging in is such a time-consuming chore. The constant crashes are aggravating. This app needs a major overhaul.",2025-04-24,5
App is trash. It won't load unless I force stop and clear cache every time. No way to lock credit cards anymore. Feedback button doesn't even work.,2025-04-24,5

"biometric sign in does not work anymore. recognizes my fingerprint but the says ""you have been signed out"" and makes me enter password",2025-04-23,5
this bank is the worst. i setup an account so i could use zelle and of course they allowed money to be sent to my account but i cant send any to someone else and the only way i can use the money i have in there is by tap to pay. what sorry company does that.,2025-04-23,5
the app and the bank it's for are very poor. I'll be going with another bank here soon...,2025-04-22,5
"zelle kept giving me the message ""Service unavailable"" three times!",2025-04-22,5
"my account never displays the correct amount and is constantly being overdrafted when I pay my bills bc it keeps displaying a false balance, if you can get a different banking account definitely do so because this bank will just continue to displace your money by not accurately displaying how much is in the account for at least a week.",2025-04-22,5
makes me bring up then asks if want to sign in to do banking on line. I even deleted the app and then re-download the app. I HATE CHANGE. I will be looking for a new bank.,2025-04-22,5

"update, it's 2025 and this app still sucks. login does work and they added lot of functionalities but the app is not stable. it will stop working and have to uninstall and reinstall for login to come up. it doesn't remember the biometrics also from 2013: Trying to log in and it doesn't work. It used to work ok for only checking balance nd max I could do is transfer from checking to savings account. And now its not even login. Discusting app and the pnc bank. Will go to other bank.",2025-04-22,5
app sucks,2025-04-21,5

mobile deposit has been shutting down the app for the past few weeks. horrible.,2025-04-21,5
Horrendous app. Cannot use it without something going wrong and being signed out,2025-04-21,5
"This has to be the worst banking app! Never had a bank tell me I can't transfer money between internal accounts. Never had a bank just decided to not allow me to see my balance for an entire day. I swear there is more down time with ""technical issues"" then there is for me to actually use it as a bank. I have multiple loans and checking and it is always a complete mess. Do better, the absolute worst!",2025-04-21,5
"very unreliable. Crashes frequently mid check deposit, logs off right after logging in, unenrolls from bio sign on frequently.",2025-04-21,5

not user friendly!,2025-04-19,5
"I constantly need to log back into the app, and biometrics always reset. This happens literally EVERY TIME I log in. EVERY SINGLE TIME. I've called to see if I could get this resolved but there's nothing they can do on their end, just suggestions of rebooting the app, clearing the cache, or checking if it's up to date. It also doesn't seem to be an issue with my phone because I've changed phones and this still happened. This is my smallest gripe out of a plethora.",2025-04-19,5
my experience hasn't been good here lately been looking into other banks,2025-04-19,5
"update 2025 this banking app continues to be sub par at best. 2024 update Still worst banking all I've ever used. It's constantly down. One of the worst apps I've used. It's made me hate pnc. Switching to another bank. I've gone into pnc multiple times to get my ID and every time I try and log in it says wrong credentials. So either pnc employees done know what they are doing our the app blows, either way I'm done with them both. This doesn't make banking easy.",2025-04-19,5
"logs out at long in. the biometric does not work, this app has gone bad over the years",2025-04-19,5

this app sucks,2025-04-18,5
Absolute garbage. Take picture of check and the app crashes. 25% chance check pictures won't register properly..I hate it.,2025-04-17,5
This app regularly kicks me out when trying to do a mobile deposit. I had to log in three separate times today just to make a deposit. Grr,2025-04-17,5

"**UPDATE** It's getting worse. Was 3 stars but now 1. Now the app tells me that it's signing me out due to inactivity, when I am signing in. Every time. Was ok until recently. Now every time I sign in with biometrics it says I am signed out due to inactivity. Sometimes it just doesn't even work and I have to close the app completely and reopen, only to be told I am signed out due to inactivity when I sign in.

old and not intuitive.,2025-04-16,5
"PNC has morphed their app into an incredibly buggy, unstable mess that just keeps getting worse. This is a financial app, yet it crashes, prevents login, transposes numbers, and frequently hangs in the middle of doing activities. This is very troubling. Seek a different bank if you want mobile banking.",2025-04-16,5
"OK - all of a sudden, I think after an app update, after signing in with biometrics, the app immediately logs you out and disables future attempts at signing in with your fingerprint. This happens EVERY time I attempt to use the app since one of PNC's crack technology team update. I have forced stopped the app, cleared storage and cache, but it still DOESN'T WORK. Please fix whatever you broke!",2025-04-15,5
"Difficult app to use in general. Also, it's absurd that you don't allow Zelle on your web log in from a computer and require the mobile app to use that feature",2025-04-15,5
"Down. right. horrid. its basically useless. Logs you off for no apparent reason. no functions ever work. Transfers, mobile deposit, link accounts..always say temporary unavailable. temporary is hours, a day maybe. not weeks, mo the, years, FOREVER. Mortgage account, ok, let's me see balance. Why can't I make a simple extra payment. why do I have to go to the web page to do anything? what good is an app which only allows you to see balance.",2025-04-15,5
"terrible! The app keeps closing as soon as I sign in. The user interface is not intuitive, clunky, and doesn't offer all the features that other banking apps do. I wouldn't expect much considering my experience with the actual bank in person and end online is equally dissatisfying.",2025-04-15,5
"This app used to work perfectly. Now, mobile deposit is a total mess. It often logs me out after I take a photo of the check. Or it tells me that photo capture did not work. Need to fix these bugs.",2025-04-15,5
"Always having issues. Now everytime I log in, a window pops up saying ""thanks for logging out.""",2025-04-15,5

"The app is almost unusable, it forgets biometrics every 1-2 attempts, it signs you out randomly. This has been going on for weeks. When are you going to fix this?",2025-04-14,5
Barely functions. Every time I log in it tells me I've been logged out. After years of this app getting steadily worse I think it just time to get a new bank altogether,2025-04-14,5

"Terrible App. It's been two weeks that I cant log on and I keep getting a message that ""this service is unavailable at this time"". Total failure Edit: The worst mobile banking app ever. How can one be unable to log in for two weeks and the bank officers can't help. Trash this thing. While at I am transferring my funds elsewhere!",2025-04-13,5
"Primary complaint is that you can't paste your password into the password field. If that is a security feature, I don't see the value, but it makes it inaccessible. And if you enter a partial, and then look at notes, the partial is wiped. So if you have one of those passwords that is so secure that you can't memorize it, you can't access your account on this app unless you have it written down outside your secured phone. :( Great interest rates on your savings though. :)",2025-04-13,5

Out of other Bank apps like Chase, Amex, Discover and Citi... PNC app has the most issue.",2025-04-12,5

"It's a poorly coded app. There are instances where it always crashes. It crashes when you take photos of checks. Logs you out right after you enter your login info which is a pain when you have two step verification. If you leave the app to go to another and come right back it logs you out. On the bright side, it's really good at detecting the amount on checks and when some people's handwriting looks like chicken scratches.",2025-04-11,5
"I used to give this app a 5 star review, but lately my app is not opening and it's very frustrating",2025-04-11,5
"the app has become super unstable. constantly asking me to log in twice. or immediately crashing after logging in. the reason I'm writing this review in the first place is because of what just happened. I tried to login and check my spending when the app froze, and then proceeded to brick my phone. my phone spent 30 minutes restarting, bricking, then restarting again until I got it to open in safe mode and had it boot from my last backup. I got away with it because I'm a more experienced user.",2025-04-10,5
"The app used to work well. After the recent update, it now makes me log in twice. The first time it immediately signs me out and makes me re-login. This issue also ""unenrolls"" me from biometrics. In addition, the app signs me out if I switch apps for just a moment.",2025-04-10,5
"[April 2025] Enroll in the app doesn't work at all, it keeps telling me that banking isn't available. The website works fine. The app keeps turning off biometrics, for no reason whatsoever. I can't use that feature at all. I also keep getting signed out instantly as I sign in. The icing on the cake is that I cannot deposit checks due to errors which fault lies under pnc's staff. **This is officially the worst banking app I've ever used. Somehow worse than the citizen's bank app, very hard to do.",2025-04-10,5
"if I could give you no stars I would. I've never had any issues you until yesterday..i was transferred to the zelle department. i wasn't rude or anything, the person spoke to me in a language that I could not understand. i said what did you say, still no answer from them and then I got upset I said what did you say to me. then they hung up on me. uncalled for and not professional.",2025-04-10,5

I used to love this app. but lately the biometrics always says it's not working and turns off. Then it will tell me my password is wrong when it's not and I have to reset my password just to get into the app. If the service is even available at the time because it seems to be down a lot as well. it's almost easier to call or drive into the bank to get the information.,2025-04-08,5

2 stars because it sometimes works. who did you pay to make this app? I swear it's messing with me on purpose. why would I press login? does it say I'm logging out?,2025-04-26,5

This app was working good until a few months ago. It automatically kicks me out with the time out message and I just input in my passwords. Same happens with the biometrics fingerprint feature.,2025-04-06,5
this app is very unstable. It often logs me out without warning. tells me I've unenrolled in biometrics when I haven't. It often tells me the services are down when I'm trying to access my statements. it's a very frustrating banking app. the only thing I really like about it are the tools it has and that it will text me an update when there has been a deposit..,2025-04-05,5

"not a good UX or UI experience , not a good biometric log in experience, mid tier app at best. I am only leaving this review so it stops nagging me. It's incredibly hard to find anything in the UI. it feels like it has two banking apps rolled into. one a more modern design that is equally poor and hidden behind 2 or 3 taps, and an older design that has most of the banking information. Data visualization is horrid, they always do maintenance at night and can't be used 2/5 at best.",2025-04-04,5
"This ""save now"" doesn't transfer money to savings. Webx is only way to move money to Growth fund. please fix it.",2025-04-04,5
The app actually has excellent functionality. That would be a 4 or 5 star experience. the problem is that the authentication components are horrible. Biometrics turns off somewhat randomly. Password authentication counts connection timeouts as attempts. I have been locked out of my accounts about once a week for months. No I am not forgetting my password.

Ever since PNC has taken over my bank their mobile app has locked me out at least three times a year. It almost never remembers login preferences at least not for long. Customer support has rarely been helpful. They usually just have to force their way through.

CONSTANTLY crashes for as long as I've had this app. On a Pixel 7. This app blows.,2025-01-22,5
Often will not let you use it.,2025-01-22,5
Problems all the time accessing and working with your app,2025-01-21,5
Frequently won't open with biometric OR password sign in. Very inconvenient and extremely frustrating.,2025-01-20,5
Not enough tools to make the experience,2025-01-18,5
Great service,2025-01-18,5
Don't load up everytime it keeps turning my fingerprint off,2025-01-17,5
"This app continues to lock up while I'm trying to use it, also kicks me out in the middle of a deposit, and freezes up my phone and many times had uninstall the app and still same issues",2025-01-17,5
many initial problems and and customer service is not helpful.,2025-01-17,5
"Night shift exists, there is no reason to prevent people from accessing their transaction history and prevent them from locking and unlocking their accounts in the early hours of the morning",2025-01-16,5
Hate how my transactions don't update in real time I have to Wait till Tuesday to get updates with dates.,2025-01-16,5
"This app is horrible. I love the bank and what they offer is absolutely amazing. But the app stinks, I get kicked out of biometric regularly... It continually gets stuck thinking... And just feels like sometimes. It is so stressful to get my info. Biometrics is absolutely no. 1! The most important thing for me is that I don't have to actually punch in my password. Because my phone gets hacked and punching in the password is how they get my information. And it leaks to the black web.",2025-01-14,5
Ta in es too long to load,2025-01-14,5
"Hard to sign in..every time I try to use the app, it does not recognize my info, therefore, I have to keep changing my password...very frustrating!",2025-01-14,5
Don't open an account online.,2025-01-14,5
I haven't even been able to enroll it keeps saying it don't recognize my info well duh lol I don't like it already,2025-01-13,5
Always crashing & the log in us horrible. No changes in years.,2025-01-12,5
"I like what they are trying to to do with the virtual wallet, but the app and website are very buggy and don't always work.",2025-01-12,5
The biometrics turn off all the time!,2025-01-11,5
Please...please fix the bug that's been in the app forever that logs you out of the app after trying a mobile check deposit. This has been doing this for months. It takes 2 logins and attempts to deposit any check.,2025-01-11,5
"09/01/2025 - App crashes and can't use zelle. 2024 1. Mobile deposit fails to detect the amount during scanning. After 15 attempts, finally it worked. 2. App constantly crashes and unable to login at times. Pls fix this asap",2025-01-10,5
This is the first time in months that my account is functional electronically at PNC,2025-01-04,5
"Mediocre app, making mortgage payments is unnecessarily complicated.",2025-01-02,5
It inconveniencing me A LOT OF TIMES,2024-12-31,5
This app works only half the time.,2024-12-31,5
"This app used to be good, end of year, it has been garbage. Keeps acting like I need to reset my password, when I don't need to. I Logged into my computer and had no issues. Keeps saying I have no connection when Data and WiFi is on. Won't let me on the app to send Zelle, but when I decided to go on my computer or online, it won't let me send Zelle, it says to use the mobile app THAT DOES NOT WORK!!!!!",2024-12-31,5
There is such a thing as being too secure that you're locked out of your account more times than you access it.,2024-12-31,5
"This app is extremely unreliable when you need it to be. Sometimes I'm met with ""services unavailable"" for no reason. My biometrics settings are reset probably once weekly. I may as well just use my password every time, but that isn't even saved sometimes. I feel like the app just resets itself whenever it wants.",2024-12-30,5
Logging in is painful. It's full of ads for services that I obviously don't need or don't qualify to receive. Check scanning has improved.,2024-12-28,5
App constantly freezes. 9 out of 10 times I try to log on their is an update preventing from doing so.,2024-12-27,5
"Always crashes,freezes,etc.",2024-12-26,5
Does not accept information,2024-12-25,5
"I like the simplicity, but it keeps disabling biometrics",2024-12-24,5
This app go out to much. It works one day. Then the next day it don't. It's very slow,2024-12-24,5
"This app makes every other branch bank look good. Crashes constantly, can't access your balance half of the time. What's the point of it then? The updates are to ""enhance user experience"" but when the app doesn't work half of the time what's the goal here? ""Service is unavailable"". That's the BEST way to describe this app. People use mobile banking. For as much money as PNC has you would think that maybe they'd have an app that's worth something.",2024-12-23,5
I cant figure out how to get it on my home screen,2024-12-22,5
Sucked,2024-12-21,5
Not so good anymore. Even with Biometrics you still have to go through hoops to login. The latest upgrade caused me to reboot my phone four times and finally had to remove PNC app and reinstall it,2024-12-21,5
Below average Random fees at abnormal times get transacted,2024-12-20,5
"The app is just really janky. I'm sure the bank is good, but with how inconvenient this app is it didn't take long for me to switch back to my old one. Their website is slightly better but it looks like it hasn't been updated since they bought the domain. Would probably be 5 stars if they put more effort into their online services.",2024-12-20,5
Can't login 90% of the time from the app and have to go use a computer. It worked great for years but now hardly ever works.,2024-12-20,5
App is fine. However you can't paste your passwords into the password field on login. This effectively stops users from using complicated passwords generated in other apps like Bitwarden or LastPass. Not user friendly.,2024-12-20,5
The sign in fails almost everytime and you have to reselect the biometrics option.,2024-12-19,5
Is not working,2024-12-19,5
"There is a TON that I can say about PNC business banking. It's definitely not good. It's my opinion that certain business owners get loans instead of a line of credit on a card. Then, the fees are ridiculous for the threshold. The app is ok for the most part but to not be able to wire someone money from a business account is terrible to me.",2024-12-19,5
I keep having to re-enroll to use biometrics to many times. This is getting ridiculous. How about an update that doesn't keep doing that?,2024-12-18,5
When PNC sold out to whatever other company everything has gotten unbearable to use. It's an ok app for the worst bank. Only use if you want to give all your bank info to foreign conglomerates who manage multiple companies.,2024-12-17,5
It's a trash app that randomly logs me out and then just says that it can't communicate with the server or something like that so I can't get back in which is incredibly frustrating.,2024-12-15,5
"When it works, it's great. However, it feels like recently, the app doesn't work. I get the ""this service is unavailable"" message a lot.",2024-12-13,5
I keep getting a message saying PNC isn't responding.,2024-12-11,5
"Consistently flakey, always changing. In the past, this app has had a variety of issues using the camera for check deposit. (That seems ok now.) Now the app is constantly disabling biometric (fingerprint) login, claiming my biometrics on my phone have changed. (They haven't.) It's always something, indicating poor software QA. Not a good sign from your bank.",2024-12-11,5
Just once I'd like to open this app without having to update it first. Every time I use it I have to update. Removing a star. Had to update again.,2024-12-09,5
"App crashes all the time, desperately needs bug fixes or something to get it working. Very difficult to do business with the bank. Highly recommend searching for a better alternative at least on Android. Feels like it's stuck in the 1990's with how outdated it is.",2024-12-09,5
"Doesn't remember login when selected, often need to restart app to enter my login info, won't remember biometric login, often says it's ""Unavailable"" until I restart the app. Don't know how a bank like PNC drops the ball this hard.",2024-12-08,5
The app works as it should... IF PNC ONLINE BANKING IS WORKING.... Probably once a week I can't access my account because PNC can't maintain a working online banking system...,2024-12-07,5
"App is glitchy and freezes or crashes often, every time I open it.",2024-12-06,5
Horrible,2024-12-03,5
App constantly has issues and constantly goes down. Something as important as banking should have more attention and effort put into it.,2024-12-03,5
Gltichy. Constantly having to close the app and restart to get it to behave normally,2024-12-02,5
"Works, but only if I clear cache and memory, force stop the app, then reopen with my details all over again. Otherwise the app just crashes after trying to open it the second time since clearing cache. I've tried reinstalling, restarting to no avail. Way too much work for what should be quick access to my financials",2024-12-02,5
"Latest version of the mobile app keeps disabling biometric login, then I need to force stop the app before I can log in to reactivate the option. Very frustrating!",2024-12-02,5
"Never wants to recognize ""biometrics"". Always have to enter password, sometimes text to verify.",2024-12-02,5
access to your funds in 2024 is still dinosaur age with how rapid expenses are.,2024-12-01,5

"Its predecessor, BBVA, was a much better and more robust app than PNC.",2024-11-30,5
App keeps crashing. I have to constantly uninstall and reinstall or wait later for it to work,2024-11-30,5
Lack of help and zelle hasn't worked with this bank for like 3 weeks now,2024-11-28,5
Always hangs up when trying to access,2024-11-28,5
Everything is cumbersome with PNC,2024-11-27,5
Fingerprint sometimes isn't asked upon launch. I can't automate zelle payments like Chase Bank.,2024-11-27,5
Another useless update that doesn't allow me to use biometrics also it won't save my login information on my phone anymore and have to sign in and use my password again and get an email to activate my account,2024-11-26,5
"While I feel like the inopportune times of the servers being down is getting better, now I'm faced with biometrics shutting itself off at random times for no reason. Really frustrating to deal with, considering this isn't an issue with any other app I use biometrics to log in with (i.e. Discover)",2024-11-26,5
Horrendous service and inconvenient polices. Almost archaic system which requires a physical presence to fix errors that they create regardless of ability to verify identity.,2024-11-24,5
"This is by far the best version! Also please don't make any changes, we are all used to it, it works perfect. You don't have to reinvent the wheel. **Update I had to drop it down to a two-star because I cannot get the check capture to work. It constantly states that it's not clear enough. Well it's plenty bright in here against the dark contrast and my lens is clean yet it will not work ü§∑üèº When it gets fixed I'll bring it back up to five stars.",2024-11-24,5
I sure wish I could do a textural search on an account. I'd like to be able to search for transactions by name either by exact match or contains text. My Bank of America app allows this and I miss this feature in your app.,2024-11-24,5

This app is a HOT MESS. I had to uninstall and reinstall it for it to work...Let's see how long this one lasts!!,2025-05-21,5
"App is fine unless you want to deposit a check. It keeps saying ""null"" and ""0.00"" to be deposited. Update: it's been almost a month since I left my review, and mobile deposit still isn't working.",2025-05-21,5
Makes me log in twice every time I use the app.,2025-05-21,5
"Overall, a slick, useful and relatively well-designed app, at least visually. Code-wise, the app is quite busted to say the least. it gives false ""service not available"" warnings, crashes, or logs me out almost every time I try to access my accounts, and keeps deleting my biometric data. This has been an issue as long as I've been with PNC, but got a lot worse a couple months ago with one of the updates. Hopefully it gets fixed soon.",2025-05-21,5
The Biometric login is kicking me out quite frequently. The app is getting stuck when I log in with my password. this is all in the last 3 months.,2025-05-20,5
most of the app works fantastic. unfortunately the biometric system is constantly being turned off even when I log out and try to log back in another day. I've restarted the biometrics multiple times. it's a waste of time when I'm trying to get something done. please fix this,2025-05-20,5
still closes the app while trying to make a deposit,2025-05-20,5

"The multiple logins back to back make no sense. Biometrics never work. I enter my username and password and then it signs me out? it makes no sense. info once you get in is fine, Zelle works fine, but wow, the login setup is a mess.",2025-05-16,5
Love this bank. but the app crashes and removes my biometric scan all the time. I have to open and close it like. 3 times. so many issues,2025-05-16,5
It works to log in and check your balance but it's not really reliable for anything beyond that. More than half the time the app will crash while trying to deposit a check and then each time you have to log back in and start again. I wish I could say this was a version issue but I've had this for the last 6 years over many versions and phones and it's always the same.,2025-05-16,5
"Every update makes it worse. Often offline or no Zelle. Slow, clumsy. 'Enhancements' are more sales pitches.",2025-05-15,5

1st time use was frustrating. okay now!,2025-05-14,5
Pixel 8 pro. it keeps disabling the biometric sign on. very annoying. I obviously have no choice but to use the app unless I change banks,2025-05-14,5

Though I love PNC the mobile app crashes frequently. And I have to unlock it frequently as well. Doesn't save user name or biometrics.,2025-05-13,5
Used to be 5 star then an update and the app keeps closing. I've uninstalled reinstalled and it keeps shutting down,2025-05-12,5
"I am a samsung user.. this app is simply a hit or miss.. for example; it's 10:42pm at the bar, your friend offers to pay, assuming you will just zelle them the money for your part. You attempt to log in. It's either maintenance or a lag that prevents you from loading in. Not all the time, but enough frustration for me to write a review. Also, I am comparing this to the apps from other banks, which include: Bank of America, Chase, BMO.... THIS app runs very slow compared to others.",2025-05-12,5

Not a very efficient app.,2025-05-11,5
"It's great when it actually allows me to actually login. More times than I can count recently, I'll go through the login in process and it will automatically tell me I have been signed out.

"good services, just wish they were functional most of the time.",2025-05-11,5
"I have been using this app since 2019 and it worked fine until Mar 2025, but since recently it got annoying as it signs off automatically as soon as I log in. But one good thing is when I log in for the 2nd time, it stays open. I tried uninstalling and installing, but it still didn't solve the problem",2025-05-10,5
Sometime it doesn't work 3 years later and it's even worse. It crashes almost every time I try to use it. Taking it down from 3 stars to 2 and next time it asks me to review it will go down to 1. 5.8.25 it's gotten a little better. it still crashes and freezes but not as often.,2025-05-10,5
For the past few months the mobile deposit feature doesn't work correctly. After taking the second picture of the back of the check it logs me out of the app. After I sign back in and repeat the whole process it works. Always fails and does the log out on the first attempt,2025-05-09,5

"It feels like every single time i need this app the most, it crashes (which is rare) or forces me to manually log in instead of using biometrics which is just as secure if not more secure than the password that someone could snag while shoulder surfing if i so happen to check that i didn't put it in wrong. Very annoying and inconvenient. Other than that, ill say the app is very good. If you want me to change my password for security purposes, it should be a notification within the app",2025-04-29,5

this app has been great for a long time. however for the last year or so. it randomly will refuse to open and freeze. making it very annoying to take care of finances. especially when it constantly happens when you really need it.,2025-04-04,5
Ehh. Since the last update it says I have been signed out as soon as I sign back in. I have cleared my cache. Guess it's time to uninstall and reinstall see if that helps. Before this issue it was fine.,2025-04-04,5

"NEEDS A DARK MODE! App is easy to use. My only suggestion would be that when it comes to editing the categories for Transaction X, that once I have selected the new category for it that it continues to update the category for that type of transaction as I have selected until I feel that it's time to readjust again. For example, Gas Buddy transactions always end up being listed as a Utility, and I want it to be listed under Gas and Fuel. Currently I have to do that manually.",2025-03-20,5

It often doesn't recognize my password nor does it allow me to use biometrics. Very frustrating,2025-03-17,5
"This app works some of the time, because I find myself having to re-enroll for biometrics authentication too often, it is annoying. Lately the new issue is, once I use biometrics it says that the app is not available, so I have to authenticate again and then it works. I shouldn't have to input my password in this often to log in.

Always liked this app but lately biometrics has been crashing every time you put it on. It works for a while crashes and have to log in manually. fix it please,2025-03-16,5

Not very user friendly. It needs to be made simpler. Copy the one from Chase. It's that easy. And I still don't know if this one's gonna work. Directions are not clear,2025-02-27,5
Lately I have had to re-establish my bimetrics every single time I login. I use my biometrics and it states I was logged out. Then once I log back in with password it asks if I want to re-enroll. Based on reading reviews this has been an issue and the app developer has done nothing to resolve the issue. It has been happening for months now.,2025-02-27,5
I would give it more stars if it wouldn't keep disabling the fingerprint log in. This bug needs to be fixed! I have a Galaxy 23 Plus so I don't know if it's an Android thing.,2025-02-27,5

"please add a ""trust this device"" feature to bypass the SMS step after the first time! the app presents a pretty good range of capabilities, but my experience is dominated by friction authenticating ... much of which is ""security theater"" that doesn't deter any real threat. why: if I already entered an on-device biometric passkey what is the SMS proving?? any attacker holding this phone who got past that step will receive the SMS right here, just like I would. all it does is slow me down",2025-02-25,5

"I don't mind the app as much as when you talk to some of the people for the Help option. They literally pick you apart.

They will not respond well and if your a woman and you change your name make sure you get proof they close out your old card, destroy it in front of you and everything because it can be left opened I found out.",2025-02-19,5

"Well so far so good ..... Seems to be an all right app although it's been a challenge to get used to or know how to do what I need to do in the app. I will say also, it sucks that you can use the virtual card for Google Pay as well as tap to pay but your not able to actually set a pin number so unable to access any cash back and that's DRIVING ME CRAZYZ also I am unable to find my full account and routing numbers anywhere on the app. So I'm so confused and no one knows anything of course üò≠üòûüò≠",2025-02-11,5

"Biometrics fails. A month or two ago it stopped working and i had to enter my password. After entering the password i was prompted to set up biometrics.

Issue with Zelle. App freezes when using,2025-01-31,5
"Often logs me out immediately after logging me in. Often logs me out when I switch apps to check my security code. If I try to use Zelle and deny it permission to access my contacts it logs me out rather than allowing me to enter an email address directly. There is a workaround - I just need to click outside the permission access pop-up dialog box, but that is not intuitive. Locks me out of Zelle if I enter the wrong PIN in both the entry and confirmation boxes, which appear at the same time.",2025-01-31,5
so far so good,2025-01-31,5
Sucks pnc forces you to use their app to access Zelle. Often logs me out the moment I'm logged in. I like remote deposit.,2025-01-31,5

It works ok but i wish it was more reliable and smother.,2025-01-28,5
How much is PNC Bank worth?? You would think they would have a great app but this app is the most dysfunctional non-working app that I use regularly. Update: Now the biometrics is only available on occasion and I have to sign in via typing my password and after I do that it logs me out instantly and I have to do it again. It's frustratingly inconsistent.,2025-01-28,5
"The app crashed frequently, kicking me out when I'm in the middle of a deposit and frequently forgets my biometric selection, this resetting and making me login with my password.",2025-01-27,5

Plain and confusing,2025-01-23,5

My only issue is the zelle feature. I can send money but can't receive money that someone sent me.,2025-01-23,5
"Works well most of the time, but when really needed the app screws up. Some examples below: 1. Frequent maintenance outages at night. Kind of annoying if you're on the West Coast time zone. 2. Transfers fail in the app constantly which forces me to maintain a backup bank account. 3. Account balances are not visible some times. 4. Mobile check deposit does not work most times. Same check deposit works on another bank app. This app is what keeps me from making pnc my primary account.",2025-01-22,5
Some times network down .,2025-01-21,5
It works. Not a problem. But it forgets the biometric sign in once in awhile. And it's not easy to get to where you want to go. But it does work,2025-01-19,5
The app has not been opening going on almost a month now.,2025-01-18,5
The only good thing I like about the PNC Bank app is that immediately you can see how much is in your checking and savings account but trying to find your card number is difficult trying to find your routing number and your account number and your cards to turn on and off all super difficult too many steps.,2025-01-18,5
"Every other time I log into the app, my biometrics are shut off and I have to keep re-enabling them. Also why does the external transfer not work? This has been ""not working"" for over a month now....and I can't send money from one account to an account at a different bank...",2025-01-17,5

"Conflicted on this app. It crashes nearly every time I use it or tells me the service is unavailable and then works immediately upon reload. The biometric sign in breaks nearly every time you have to manually log in. Which is often because the app crashes so much.

I do like that it has mobile deposit though and it works so it's a middle of the road experience.",2024-12-31,5

It's still not perfect and has issues now and again with signatures on the back of checks but it's better. I'm not a fan of the new system where they converted checking accounts to virtual wallets.
