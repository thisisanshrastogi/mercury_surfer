I loathe 5/3 and if interest rates were not so horrible and the economy was better I would go with anyone but them. I've had issue after issue with them ever since my mortgage got sold to them. I did NOT choose them and never would. Really too bad ZERO stars isn't an option!,2025-05-24,1

Fix your app guys!!! The mobile check deposit doesn't work 5 out of 10 times. It says There was a problem with your endorsement. Ensure you have signed the back of the check and retake the photo. Keeps saying that when all is good with the check. Frustrating!!!,2025-05-19,1

"Communicating with 5th 3rd reps on their app & 800 number was a waste of time and energy. No help. 5th 3rd is not making everyday life as their customer a 5th 3rd better. In my experience, 5th 3rd as a whole has gotten a 5th 3rd worse.",2025-05-17,1

not being able to transfer money at 5am is terrible timing.,2025-05-07,1
Terrible,2025-05-06,1
It's random chance on my ability to log into my account. Sometimes smart shield let's me in and sometimes it doesn't. I have to force close and log into the app around 5-10 times sometimes before it will let me in.,2025-05-05,1
"Useless app. I recently upgraded my phone and when I installed and tried to use the app, it does not allow me. I spoke with two different reps about this and they said it ""needed time to verify my phone for security reasons"". One said I can use the app in 2 weeks (it has already been 3) and the other said 4 weeks. I've been having to use the website to bank and it's inconvenient. I've never experienced this when upgrading and will likely switch banks because of the poor service.",2025-05-04,1
Electronic deposits work less than 50% of the time,2025-05-03,1
I do not like having to wait days for my mobile deposit. Some of us need our money immediately.,2025-05-03,1
This bank will not let me zelle no money out because I had 3 over drafts in one month. they just allowed me to zelle money into the account but I have no way to get my out. there external transfers are not working. i will have to go to an ATM or bank to get money out. what a horrible way to do business. i will be closing this account due to this. I feel like my money is at hostage now in this account. IF YOU DON'T ALLOW TO ZELLE MONEY OUT DON'T ALLOW TO ZELLE IT IN THEN!,2025-05-02,1
"Customer doesn't know hold was placed on debit card transaction for medical equipment, in person transaction card declined because of hold. Bank provides only part of what is needed- the reason why declined. BUT is unable to release Hold status. Call Fraud line - 40 minutes still on hold. Heavy call volumes - 5/3 might want to hire more people to answer the problems your customers experience. Wondering how many complain because a 40 minute wait isn't considered good customer service.",2025-05-01,1
horrible app horrible support,2025-04-30,1

I'm tired of not being able to log in or see my account balance. I'm seriously considering switching banks. this is ridiculous,2025-04-28,1
The app will not allow me to utilize all online banking utilities as stated. 5/3 offers customers ATM/debit transactions without a physical card - several attempts were made to select a virtual card using the app. Quite helpful when you're traveling. If it worked! 😞,2025-04-27,1
my phone was stolen. theivs cleaned me out,2025-04-26,1

app don't work half the time,2025-04-25,1
"This app sucks since Smart Shield was added. I can't switch between my accounts without logging off and logging back on. Transferring money between accounts is a PIA now too. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app twice and it still has the same issues. I see others have the same problem, so not sure why 5/3 hasn't addressed this issue.",2025-04-24,1
"This is about the 3rd update to this ""new"" app. Logging into my accounts depends on time of day, weather, oceanic waves and moon cycles. The original app had no issues but someone had an idea to ""make improvements"", which has lead to inconsistent UX. Also, why would you leave credits/debits all the same color? It's challenging to quickly glance transactions. The help desk cannot help other than apologize. 4/25 update- ugh, ability to log on to the app against depends if mercury is in renegade!",2025-04-23,1
"App is messed up after the last update. I log in go to 1st account, then I want to check 2nd account. I get thrown back into 1st account. it will not let me do anything else not even log out.

No Answers From 5/3!",2025-04-22,1
Internal transfers don't work well. Difficult time logging out. My android phone is up to date. App is not good!,2025-04-21,1
worst ever. trying to get log in info and when I click on forget login it takes you to a screen to put your information in and it says it wrong....but I out the correct and the customer service line is not helpful either,2025-04-21,1
Login Issues make the services unusable. Getting errors on login and needing to reset password constantly is not acceptable. Will be leaving this bank with fractional service for a more whole banking experience.,2025-04-21,1
the old ver was better where you could see the balance on the corner. no need to log in and the whole app ran faster,2025-04-20,1
"After making my monthly payment, I see no way to see if the payment is in process. This should be easily accessible and it's not.",2025-04-18,1

customer service is horrible. I had to call multiple times to find out how to make a loan payment. the app is horrible. I will never use this bank,2025-04-18,1
been trying for more than 1 hour to log on with new phone! Now I'm told to try tomorrow!;This is very poor system!,2025-04-18,1
Why am I prompted to share my location each time I log on? Maybe I don't want everyone knowing where I am.,2025-04-17,1
don't want it,2025-04-16,1
Worst app. so many glitch. you cannot add email ID for receiving the code..which is annoying. Even smallest banks of USA offers these alternative options,2025-04-15,1

"0 stars this app is a waste of time.. 53 asks me to use chat but 10 mins in, after they join call, they aren't responding.. thanks for wasting my time. call, hit # instead of pin, answered in 2 minutes and transferred to who I need in moments. app is horrible experience",2025-04-15,1
its doesn't let me go on the app,2025-04-15,1
"I would give this app zero stars. Constantly having to update it so I have to delete stuff off my phone to make space. I have NOTHING left to delete and now the app won't even download. It keeps either saying it needs more space or pending. I know my phone is old and junk, but I shouldn't have to buy a new phone just to get online access to my bank. I can't even get on the website and the bank told me it was because I needed to update my phone.",2025-04-15,1
What has happened with the widget for your balance? Not working anymore after recent update. Another fix that made the app even more broken. Keep fixing things that's not broke.,2025-04-15,1
"Tried to cancel an auto payment, was told they couldn't help me without a $30+ fee. When I expressed my discontent, I was immediately kicked from the chat on the app. Reduced to a 1 star because there's constantly ""maintenance"" being done and I'm never able to sign into this app after 5pm. Abs horrible banking app. Not to mention its funny they can't process deposits certain days or over night, but have no problem charging you over $100 in over draft fees. overAWAY!!!!!",2025-04-15,1

"If there was an option for 1/2 star that's all this app would get. Ever since the last 2 updates and smart shield was added, the app sucks! I go into transfer funds, it doesn't bring up my accounts. I contacted customer service and they told me to uninstall it and reinstall it and now I have to do that every time I try to do anything in the app. Very disappointed, I never had a problem with it before.",2025-04-12,1
"Just downloaded the ""updated version"" of this app, and now I can not access my account at all. I typed in my username and password, hit go and just saw bouncing dots, then username and password disappeared and all you see are the bouncing dots.

constant log in issues with this app either telling me something went wrong to try again or my user name and password can't be found. the best part is I log in with my fingerprint. I dunno who has to get fired. but this is getting stupid that I can't even look at my balance,2025-04-10,1

"If the app did what it promised and actually offered better interest rates, then I wouldn't have switched. I still have an open credit card with them, so I wanted to keep the app to properly monitor it, but it was not worth it to receive a low balance of $0 on an account that no longer exists. Their ""solutions"" were already things I tried and had told them as such.",2025-04-04,1
worst app I've ever used. it keeps going back to the previous screen. can't even use the app. go back to the previous app 2yrs ago. or get a new web developer,2025-04-04,1

"I would give this NEGATIVE stars if possible. Why is the cardless ATM function under ""Move Money""??? Took me and the teller 15 minutes to find it. And then it keeps quitting and signing me out before I can get it to line up with the QR code! Takes 6 tries to get it to work every time!! Their ATMs keep getting hacked and then I get locked out after hours when they have no customer service (the online helper can't do anything). Oh, and good luck sending a Zelle payment...

"Login is badly broken on Android. The app crashes when you try to paste a password. Every. Single. Time. Worse, the username and password are *cleared* if you switch away from the app to look up your password. You are forced to enter your username and password without copy/paste, and without looking it up. That's crazy. You need to find a way to work with password managers. Crashing the app when the clipboard is used is pretty terrible. I hope that's not by design. Please do better.",2025-03-21,1

"Horrible. Trying to establish cardless ATM and had to replace my first card as it got lost in the mail. Then I activate the card and it won't show on the app. Literally overdraw me for checks I didnt even want. Then the chat staff are about as helpful as Google is--scratch that, less so. Zelle gave me issues too on here. Tbh huge inconvenience, always ends up requesting I verify in person. I don't have a car ATM so this is incredibly inconveniencing 🤦🏻‍♀️",2025-03-14,1

This idiotic app can get a direct deposit half the time and the other half its random times. The ledger doesn't even keep track of payments correctly and sometimes takes a few days to even correctly itself. It'll say I have plenty of 1 second then cut it in half for no reason. It's almost like in being stolen from and can't keep track on purpose by this shady bank.,2025-03-05,1

The app will not allow me to utilize all online banking utilities as stated. 5/3 offers customers ATM/debit transactions without a physical card - several attempts were made to select a virtual card using the app. Quite helpful when you're traveling. If it worked! 😞,2025-04-27,2

Update....

You have to do something about this app. It has caused tremendous problems for me. Every time you log in it just says we don't have a valid number on file. I've had this account now for a few years and I'm telling you there is always something wrong. I really want to like your bank because of the location and the young ladies that work at my local branch. But between the ATM and this app I don't think I'll ever fully move my Bank of America account over to you guys. Told to call back later. LOL,2025-01-17,3

unfortunately after 15 years I had to leave fifth third &go with CHASE. customer service locked my main checking account and for weeks not one individual I was transfered to could help. this led to over drafts while I was never able to view my account.

It works as expected about 3/5 of the time (hence the 3 stars). Most common have been issues with mobile deposit, or logging in.

overall the app is okay better since you can now chat with a representative anytime.

Update.... This app really does suck when trying to capture a check picture.. tells you to use a dark background and then it tells you that the quality isn't that good after using a dark background and trying to get the best clearest picture.. says it isn't good enough.. what a piece of junk..,2025-01-19,4

You have to do something about this app. It has caused tremendous problems for me. Every time you log in it just says we don't have a valid number on file. I've had this account now for a few years and I'm telling you there is always something wrong. I really want to like your bank because of the location and the young ladies that work at my local branch. But between the ATM and this app I don't think I'll ever fully move my Bank of America account over to you guys. Told to call back later. LOL,2025-01-17,4

unfortunately after 15 years I had to leave fifth third &go with CHASE. customer service locked my main checking account and for weeks not one individual I was transfered to could help. this led to over drafts while I was never able to view my account.

It works as expected about 3/5 of the time (hence the 3 stars). Most common have been issues with mobile deposit, or logging in. It seems as though they roll out updates without fully testing them first. Luckily I have a branch 5 minutes from my house so I can go in as needed.",2024-07-27,4

I've never had a bank not do this so you can see your actual new balance after each transaction and so you can be assured that your new balance is accurate.

So we don't know if we have new alerts or not it always says we do it, never clears after we check them. Customer service said I have to go to the main website to delete them.

I go to the ATMs to make deposit and they don't take deposits half the time if it's cash, so I drive across town to the other ATM and it's so slow and likes to hold my card until it shuts down and reboots.(Takes like 20 mins) And have never answered the phone ever",2024-04-09,4

overall the app is okay better since you can now chat with a representative anytime. My only complaint is if I misplace my card which happens frequently b/c of ADD I cannot go in and temporarily disable my card in the application. I have to chat with a representative and have them disable/enable it. Every other banking app manages to offer this capability It's Silly the 53 app doesn't.

It works as expected about 3/5 of the time (hence the 3 stars). Most common have been issues with mobile deposit, or logging in.

The issue is that when I check them, there is no option to delete or save them & the red number thing never goes away? So we don't know if we have new alerts or not it always says we do it, never clears after we check them. Customer service said I have to go to the main website to delete them.

I go to the ATMs to make deposit and they don't take deposits half the time if it's cash, so I drive across town to the other ATM and it's so slow and likes to hold my card until it shuts down and reboots.(Takes like 20 mins) And have never answered the phone ever",2024-04-09,5

overall the app is okay better since you can now chat with a representative anytime. My only complaint is if I misplace my card which happens frequently b/c of ADD I cannot go in and temporarily disable my card in the application. I have to chat with a representative and have them disable/enable it. Every other banking app manages to offer this capability It's Silly the 53 app doesn't.

I've loved the bank but I was informed when I opened the account so long as I did direct deposit of at least $300 in a month I would receive my bonus for opening the account. I've sent several emails to the gentleman that helped me open the account here in Whitestown Indiana but no response and still no $300 bonus? I am not sure if I will ever receive it. Stinks too bc the banks been wonderful to work with and I'm wanting to have the rest of my family open account there too.,2025-05-16,5

"I've been with 5/3 for well over 20 years and you actually get to know your people personally and that is what I love the most is they recognize you the minute you walk in, say Hello with your name involved, and will talk to you personally, without an appointment (if not tied up at moment) and that is what really matters to me.. I was very sad, and many others alsoto see the Whitehall branch close 😞 Hopefully, maybe a smaller one can be built, and We will be happy out in the country again 😀",2025-05-15,5

"i have been a customer of 5/3 for over 20 years now. I will admit that my family had some problems with them, but once we found one banker to work with, it was smooth sailing.
